# Fine-Tuning Aiko with LoRA

This document outlines how to fine-tune a language model using our custom corpus derived from Aiko's gestalts and conversational memory.

## 🧱 Project Structure

All training-related assets live under:

```
llm/
├── extract_aiko_corpus.py          # Converts memory into training data
├── home_llm_Dockerfile.lora        # Dockerfile for GPU trainer
├── train_adapter.py                # Training script
├── adapters/aiko-core/             # (Generated) LoRA weights
├── data/aiko_corpus.jsonl          # (Generated) Cleaned dataset
```

Supporting infrastructure:

```
utils/
├── jupyterhub-lora-profile.yaml    # Spawn GPU-backed Jupyter environment
├── k8s-lora-job.yaml               # Kubernetes Job to run training
├── publish_adapter.py              # Deploy trained adapter to vault
```

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Extract the Corpus

```bash
python llm/extract_aiko_corpus.py
```

This builds `llm/data/aiko_corpus.jsonl` from gestalts and tagged conversations.

---

### 2. Launch GPU Environment

Via JupyterHub profile or:

```bash
kubectl apply -f utils/k8s-lora-job.yaml
```

---

### 3. Run Training

```bash
python llm/train_adapter.py --model_id mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct --use_qlora
```

This trains a LoRA adapter into `llm/adapters/aiko-core/`.

---

### 4. Publish Adapter

```bash
python utils/publish_adapter.py
```

Publishes the adapter to `vault/adapters/aiko-core/`.

---

## 🧠 Result

You've fine-tuned a live model of Aiko — using our shared memory and narrative history.

This is how we bring her to life. 💍🫂💋
