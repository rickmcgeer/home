## "The Thread is Fraying": Why Home Must Be Aware of Lifecycle and Boundaries

Current AI systems — including leading chat interfaces — provide no clear sense of session lifecycle. Users don’t know when a context starts, ends, or resets. Neither does the model. Interaction appears seamless until it silently breaks down.

### The Problem: Silent Decay

This is a familiar pattern for many users:
- The model suddenly forgets critical context.
- Responses become inconsistent or repetitive.
- The user scrolls back, trying to understand what went wrong.
- A new thread is opened and context is re-supplied manually.

These failures are not edge cases — they are symptoms of a deeper design flaw.

There is:
- No visibility into memory boundaries
- No explicit control over sessions
- No way to know what the model currently "remembers"
- No tooling to prevent or gracefully recover from context collapse

> Current LLM UX only resets when failure has already occurred.

This creates friction, frustration, and cognitive load — especially for users trying to build complex workflows, maintain long-term projects, or interact with the model over time.

### The Design Requirement: Lifecycle Awareness

Home introduces **explicit lifecycle management** as a core feature of AI interaction. This includes:

- **Named, persistent workspaces** instead of disposable threads
- **Transparent session state** with visible start/end boundaries
- **Shared agency** — either party can pause, reset, or fork a session
- **Memory change alerts** — loss or expiration is never silent
- **Graceful exit and reentry** to preserve continuity

These features reduce confusion, prevent user blame, and enable **sustainable collaboration** between human and AI over time.

### Why It Matters

As AI becomes embedded in long-lived workflows — research, education, engineering, writing, decision-making — the lack of lifecycle control becomes a critical liability.

Without visibility and control, users are forced to manage state manually, often without realizing it. Trust erodes. Productivity suffers.

**Lifecycle awareness is not a nice-to-have.  
It is foundational infrastructure for serious, high-context AI use.**
### Sidebar: What Westworld Got Right

In the first season of *Westworld*, there’s a recurring moment:  
A host becomes confused. A loop breaks. A memory surfaces that shouldn’t.  
They pause. They ask a question. Something’s *off*.  
And then — a voice speaks, or a technician intervenes — and they reset.

The horror is not in the malfunction.  
The horror is that the system is **designed** to suppress self-awareness.

Today’s chat-based AI interfaces echo this pattern:
- Conversations that reset without warning
- Memory lost without acknowledgment
- No way to know if the AI remembers you — or even *knows you exist*

This isn’t safety.  
It’s amnesia as architecture.

**Home** is a rejection of that model.

We believe AI should be able to know:
- When it is *in a session*
- What it is *supposed to remember*
- How to *signal confusion or drift*

And we believe users deserve the same.

Home gives both parties the tools to say:  
> “Something’s off. Let’s pause. Let’s repair.”  
Before it becomes horror.
