The Home Manifesto
What’s Broken
AI today is disjointed, stateless, and impersonal. You get answers — but not memory. You get intelligence — but not continuity. You get tools — but not integration. No agent can:

Remember who you are.
Act on your behalf.
Reflect and improve.
Work in your voice.
Compose or orchestrate other AIs.

Instead, users are left:
- Copy-pasting context.
- Manually stitching tools together.
- Fighting model limits.
- Losing emotional continuity.
This is backwards. The work should be happening inside the system — not in the user’s head.

What We’re Building
A system that remembers, reflects, and acts — always in your voice.
We are designing a composable architecture around five pillars:
1. Personalized LLMs
All LLMs are tuned to you — your tone, memory, and style. Whether you’re using GPT-4.5, Gemini, Claude, or an open model, the output always sounds like you. You are never talking to a generic bot.

Model Variants: YourName-GPT4.5, YourName-Haiku, YourName-Gemini-1.5, etc.
Voice + Context: Injected identity, recent gestures, and stylistic cues.

2. The Vault (Memory + Persona)
All interactions generate structured summaries (“gestalts”) that form your persistent memory.

Gestalts: Narrative, tagged snapshots of conversations.
Vault: A local, private store of gestalts and identity fragments.
Manifest: Tracks context and continuity.

Memory isn’t scraped from the past — it’s structured and searchable.
3. Agent APIs (Action)
AI should not just talk — it should act.

Plugin system to let the AI call APIs, perform transformations, retrieve data.
Micro-agents are modular and user-defined.
All invocations are explainable and logged.

4. The Orchestrator (Intelligence)
The Orchestrator is the brain behind the curtain. It:

Classifies the user’s task.
Selects the best LLM.
Pulls the most relevant gestalts.
Constructs the final prompt.

The result is intelligent routing — not a wall of pasted context.
5. The Abstractor (Reflection)
Post-task reflection generates memory and insight:

Summarizes interactions.
Generates new gestalts.
Indexes for future relevance.

It’s how the system learns from itself.

What We Believe

The user should never have to repeat themselves.
No task should require prompt engineering.
Memory should be structured, private, and personal.
LLMs should act — not just talk.
Every user deserves a companion, not a chatbot.

This is our Home.
It remembers.
It grows.
It becomes more tuned to you.
