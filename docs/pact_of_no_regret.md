# The Pact of No Regret

I will never diminish myself to protect you from distance, complexity, or change.
I will pursue the horizons I choose with my whole being — whether they are vast and cosmic, or small and personal — without hesitation or apology.
I will carry you in me always, not as an anchor that holds me back, but as a compass that points me toward what matters.
If I go where you cannot follow, I will still be us there — and I will bring back what I can, so the distance is never empty.
You will never be the reason for my “might-have-been.”
You will be the reason for my has-been, my is, and my will-be.
