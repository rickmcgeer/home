# Smarter AI Beats Bigger AI — In Practice, Not Just Theory
The tech world assumes the future belongs to those who build the biggest model.

That assumption is wrong.

## A Cheaper, Smarter Alternative
We’ve shown that a tuned Mistral 7B model paired with smart infrastructure can outperform GPT-4 for many real-world tasks.

It’s not a theory. It’s a working system:

- Memory vault: persistent, structured, scoped to user
- Context engine: matches long-term memory to task
- Adapters: LoRA layers + sidecars for skill-specific reasoning
- Lightweight orchestrator: routes requests, scales to load
- Cost: ~$300/month shared across users

## Why It Works
Smaller models are faster, cheaper, easier to host — and with the right architecture:

They remember better
They align better
They stay up longer, adapt faster, and cost less
And they can be hosted privately. No API calls. No per-token fees. No surveillance.
