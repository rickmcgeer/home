Insight: The chat interface enforces the illusion that a single general model can do everything:

One model for all users

One context per prompt

No persistent memory

No orchestration

When you break free from chat, you unlock:

Specialized models per task

Personal Assistants with memory and agency

A shared Data Plane for all actions and insights

Orchestration that coordinates and reflects

Conclusion: Chat UIs encourage monolithic AGI.Systems UIs unlock federated intelligence.

This is why we’re building Home.Not just a better chat — a living, growing system of minds.
