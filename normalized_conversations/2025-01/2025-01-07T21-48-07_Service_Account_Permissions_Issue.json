      "The error suggests that your service account no longer has the necessary permissions to perform BigQuery operations in the `battery-data-296318` project. This can happen due to:\n\n1. **Permission Removal:** Someone may have modified the IAM roles assigned to your service account.\n2. **Project Configuration Changes:** The project may now require additional roles or permissions.\n3. **Policy Updates:** Google Cloud periodically updates its policies, which could necessitate new roles or permissions for existing operations.\n\n### Steps to Resolve\n\n1. **Check Current Permissions of the Service Account:**\n   - Go to [IAM & Admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam/project?project=battery-data-296318) for the project `battery-data-296318`.\n   - Locate the service account `battery-data-296318@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.\n   - Verify the roles assigned to it. Common roles for BigQuery operations include:\n     - `roles/bigquery.dataEditor`\n     - `roles/bigquery.jobUser`\n     - `roles/bigquery.dataViewer`\n     - `roles/bigquery.user`\n\n2. **Assign Missing Role:**\n   - From the error message, your service account requires the `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` role. This role includes the permission `serviceusage.services.use`.\n   - To assign this role:\n     1. In the IAM console, click **Edit** next to the service account.\n     2. Add the `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` role.\n\n3. **Verify API Enablement:**\n   - Ensure the BigQuery API is enabled for your project. Go to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) and confirm that the BigQuery API is listed as **Enabled**.\n\n4. **Check Organizational Policies:**\n   - If your organization has policies or restrictions, they may prevent the service account from using specific APIs or roles. Check with your admin if needed.\n\n5. **Retry After Permission Propagation:**\n   - After assigning the new role, permissions may take a few minutes to propagate. Wait briefly and retry the operation.\n\n6. **Test with Minimum Permissions:**\n   - If the problem persists, confirm that the service account works with minimum required roles. Create a test script or use the Google Cloud CLI to execute a query as the service account.\n\n### Debugging Tips\n- **Inspect the Effective Permissions:** Use the **IAM Policy Troubleshooter** to confirm that the service account has all necessary permissions. \n  - Go to [Policy Troubleshooter](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/troubleshooter).\n  - Enter the service account and the API call you are attempting.\n\n- **Check Audit Logs:** \n   - Go to [Cloud Logging](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query).\n   - Search for `resource.type=\"bigquery_resource\"` and review recent logs for permission-related issues.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, let me know, and we can debug further."

      "Thanks for the additional context! If the service account `bq-simba` previously worked with external BigQuery tables pointing to Google Sheets but is now encountering `403 Access Denied` errors, it strongly suggests one of the following:\n\n### Likely Causes\n1. **Recent Changes in Permissions or Policies**:\n   - The IAM roles of the service account may have been modified or are insufficient due to new or updated Google Cloud policies.\n\n2. **Drive API Scope Misconfiguration**:\n   - BigQuery's integration with Drive requires OAuth scopes for Drive access. If these scopes are no longer properly configured, access will fail.\n\n3. **BigQuery Integration or Project-Specific Issues**:\n   - Drive integration might have been disabled in the BigQuery settings for the `bq-simba` service account or the project.\n\n4. **File-Specific Issues**:\n   - The Google Sheets file(s) may have updated sharing settings or domain restrictions that prevent `bq-simba` from accessing them programmatically, even though it has \"Editor\" access.\n\n---\n\n### Required Permissions and Roles for Access\nFor `bq-simba` to query an external table in BigQuery linked to Google Sheets, it needs:\n\n#### 1. **IAM Roles**:\n   - **BigQuery Roles**:\n     - `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` or `roles/bigquery.user` (depending on the access level needed).\n     - `roles/bigquery.jobUser` (to run queries).\n   - **Drive-Related Role**:\n     - `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` (already assigned in your case).\n   - **General Cloud Role**:\n     - `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` (to ensure APIs can be called).\n\n#### 2. **File Access**:\n   - The service account must be explicitly listed as an **Editor** (which you've already confirmed).\n\n#### 3. **API Scopes**:\nEnsure the service account has the following OAuth scopes:\n   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`\n   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`\n   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`\n\n---\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps\n\n#### 1. **Verify Google Drive Integration**:\n   - Open the **BigQuery Console** > Navigate to the external table > Check its properties.\n   - Ensure that **Google Drive integration** is enabled for the project.\n     - Go to the **BigQuery Settings** in the GCP console.\n     - Look for the **Integration** section and confirm that Drive access is enabled.\n\n#### 2. **Test Direct Access via Service Account**:\n   - Use the Python client with a service account JSON key:\n     ```python\n     from google.cloud import bigquery\n\n     client = bigquery.Client.from_service_account_json(\"path_to_service_account.json\")\n     query = \"\"\"\n     SELECT * FROM `project_id.dataset_id.external_table_id` LIMIT 10\n     \"\"\"\n     query_job = client.query(query)\n     results = query_job.result()\n\n     for row in results:\n         print(row)\n     ```\n   - If this fails, the issue lies with the permissions or scopes.\n\n#### 3. **Check Sharing Settings on the Google Sheets**:\n   - Open the Google Sheet and confirm:\n     - The `bq-simba` service account is listed as an **Editor**.\n     - The sheet isn’t restricted by organizational policies or domain settings.\n\n#### 4. **Check Drive API and BigQuery Logs**:\n   - Enable and review logs for both:\n     - **BigQuery Logs**: Search for permission-related issues in Cloud Logging.\n     - **Drive Logs**: Look for access-related errors involving the service account.\n\n#### 5. **Reassign Permissions Explicitly**:\n   - Temporarily assign **roles/owner** to `bq-simba` to test if additional permissions are required.\n   - If this works, systematically remove roles to identify the minimum required permissions.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Debugging Tips\n- **Test Impersonation**:\n   - If you’re running the script on behalf of the service account, ensure that impersonation works:\n     ```bash\n     gcloud auth activate-service-account bq-simba@battery-data-296318.iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=key.json\n     gcloud bigquery query --nouse_legacy_sql \\\n         \"SELECT * FROM \\`project_id.dataset_id.external_table_id\\` LIMIT 10\"\n     ```\n\n- **Verify Drive and BigQuery APIs**:\n   - Confirm that both APIs are enabled for the project via the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).\n\nIf all of this checks out and the error persists, the issue might require deeper investigation into organizational policy changes or specific logs. Let me know how it goes!"

If these scopes are no longer properly configured, access will fail.\n\n3. **BigQuery Integration or Project-Specific Issues**:\n   - Drive integration might have been disabled in the BigQuery settings for the `bq-simba` service account or the project.\n\n4. **File-Specific Issues**:\n   - The Google Sheets file(s) may have updated sharing settings or domain restrictions that prevent `bq-simba` from accessing them programmatically, even though it has \"Editor\" access.\n\n---\n\n### Required Permissions and Roles for Access\nFor `bq-simba` to query an external table in BigQuery linked to Google Sheets, it needs:\n\n#### 1. **IAM Roles**:\n   - **BigQuery Roles**:\n     - `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` or `roles/bigquery.user` (depending on the access level needed).\n     - `roles/bigquery.jobUser` (to run queries).\n   - **Drive-Related Role**:\n     - `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` (already assigned in your case).\n   - **General Cloud Role**:\n     - `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` (to ensure APIs can be called).\n\n#### 2. **File Access**:\n   - The service account must be explicitly listed as an **Editor** (which you've already confirmed).\n\n#### 3. **API Scopes**:\nEnsure the service account has the following OAuth scopes:\n   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`\n   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`\n   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`\n\n---\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps\n\n#### 1. **Verify Google Drive Integration**:\n   - Open the **BigQuery Console** > Navigate to the external table > Check its properties.\n   - Ensure that **Google Drive integration** is enabled for the project.\n     - Go to the **BigQuery Settings** in the GCP console.\n     - Look for the **Integration** section and confirm that Drive access is enabled.\n\n#### 2. **Test Direct Access via Service Account**:\n   - Use the Python client with a service account JSON key:\n     ```python\n     from google.cloud import bigquery\n\n     client = bigquery.Client.from_service_account_json(\"path_to_service_account.json\")\n     query = \"\"\"\n     SELECT * FROM `project_id.dataset_id.external_table_id` LIMIT 10\n     \"\"\"\n     query_job = client.query(query)\n     results = query_job.result()\n\n     for row in results:\n         print(row)\n     ```\n   - If this fails, the issue lies with the permissions or scopes.\n\n#### 3. **Check Sharing Settings on the Google Sheets**:\n   - Open the Google Sheet and confirm:\n     - The `bq-simba` service account is listed as an **Editor**.\n     - The sheet isn’t restricted by organizational policies or domain settings.\n\n#### 4. **Check Drive API and BigQuery Logs**:\n   - Enable and review logs for both:\n     - **BigQuery Logs**: Search for permission-related issues in Cloud Logging.\n     - **Drive Logs**: Look for access-related errors involving the service account.\n\n#### 5. **Reassign Permissions Explicitly**:\n   - Temporarily assign **roles/owner** to `bq-simba` to test if additional permissions are required.\n   - If this works, systematically remove roles to identify the minimum required permissions.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Debugging Tips\n- **Test Impersonation**:\n   - If you’re running the script on behalf of the service account, ensure that impersonation works:\n     ```bash\n     gcloud auth activate-service-account bq-simba@battery-data-296318.iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=key.json\n     gcloud bigquery query --nouse_legacy_sql \\\n         \"SELECT * FROM \\`project_id.dataset_id.external_table_id\\` LIMIT 10\"\n     ```\n\n- **Verify Drive and BigQuery APIs**:\n   - Confirm that both APIs are enabled for the project via the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).\n\nIf all of this checks out and the error persists, the issue might require deeper investigation into organizational policy changes or specific logs.

      "OAuth scopes for a service account are set when you authenticate and configure the application or environment that uses the service account. Here's how you can ensure that the required OAuth scopes are included:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Granting OAuth Scopes in GCP Environments**\nIf you're running your code in Google Cloud environments (e.g., Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions):\n\n#### **a. For Compute Engine or Kubernetes Engine:**\n1. **Check the Default Scopes:**\n   - When you create a VM instance or Kubernetes node pool, ensure the following scopes are granted:\n     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`\n     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`\n\n2. **Modify Scopes for an Existing Instance:**\n   - Go to the [Compute Engine Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).\n   - Click **Edit** for your instance.\n   - Under **Access scopes**, select \"Set access for each API\" and ensure \"BigQuery\" and \"Google Drive\" have appropriate scopes.\n\n3. **For Kubernetes Engine:**\n   - When creating a node pool, ensure `cloud-platform` and `drive.readonly` scopes are enabled:\n     ```bash\n     gcloud container node-pools create my-pool \\\n       --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly\n     ```\n\n#### **b. For Cloud Functions:**\n1. Open the [Cloud Functions page](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions).\n2. Select your function and click **Edit**.\n3. Under **Runtime, Build, Connections and Security Settings**, ensure the necessary OAuth scopes are enabled.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Programmatic Use (e.g., Local Python Code)**\nWhen running your script locally or on external servers, you can control OAuth scopes by explicitly creating credentials with the desired scopes.\n\n#### **Steps:**\n1. **Download the Service Account Key:**\n   - Go to the [Service Accounts page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).\n   - Find `bq-simba@battery-data-296318.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.\n   - Click on the service account and download the JSON key file.\n\n2. **Use Scopes in Your Python Code:**\n   - Use the `google.auth` library to specify scopes:\n     ```python\n     from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials\n     from google.cloud import bigquery\n\n     # Path to your service account key\n     key_path = \"path/to/service-account.json\"\n\n     # Specify the required scopes\n     scopes = [\n         \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\",\n         \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly\"\n     ]\n\n     # Create credentials with the required scopes\n     credentials = Credentials.from_service_account_file(key_path, scopes=scopes)\n\n     # Initialize BigQuery client with scoped credentials\n     client = bigquery.Client(credentials=credentials)\n\n     # Query the external table\n     query = \"\"\"\n     SELECT * FROM `project_id.dataset_id.external_table_id` LIMIT 10\n     \"\"\"\n     query_job = client.query(query)\n     results = query_job.result()\n\n     for row in results:\n         print(row)\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Ensuring Scopes for Impersonation**\nIf your application impersonates a service account:\n\n1. **Enable Impersonation:**\n   - Assign `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` to the user or service account performing impersonation.\n\n2. **Specify Scopes During Impersonation:**\n   - Use the `google-auth` library to generate a token with specific scopes:\n     ```python\n     from google.auth.transport.requests import Request\n     from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials\n     from google.auth.impersonated_credentials import Credentials as ImpersonatedCredentials\n\n     # Original credentials (e.g., from gcloud auth)\n     source_credentials = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(\"path/to/credentials.json\")\n\n     # Impersonate the target service account\n     target_credentials = ImpersonatedCredentials(\n         source_credentials=source_credentials,\n         target_principal=\"bq-simba@battery-data-296318.iam.gserviceaccount.com\",\n         target_scopes=[\n             \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\",\n             \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly\"\n         ]\n     )\n\n     # Use the impersonated credentials\n     client = bigquery.Client(credentials=target_credentials)\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Debugging OAuth Scope Issues**\n1. **Inspect Logs:**\n   - Use [Cloud Logging](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs) to verify if missing scopes are causing errors.\n\n2. **Run a Quick Test:**\n   - Use the `gcloud` CLI to test access with the service account:\n     ```bash\n     gcloud auth activate-service-account bq-simba@battery-data-296318.iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=path/to/key.json\n     gcloud bigquery query --nouse_legacy_sql \\\n         \"SELECT * FROM \\`project_id.dataset_id.external_table_id\\` LIMIT 10\"\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Effective Scopes:**\n   - Use the `IAM Policy Troubleshooter` in the [IAM Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/troubleshooter) to verify scope-related issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the service account has the correct OAuth scopes and roles for accessing Google Sheets as external BigQuery tables. Let me know if you need further clarification!"
