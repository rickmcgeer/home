      "The error message indicates that the Google API call is missing the required `PROJECT_ID` in the resource name. This can occur when the `gspread` authentication process or the service account configuration isn't set up correctly to identify the project.\n\n### Steps to Resolve\n\n1. **Verify the Service Account Key**\n   - Ensure your `service_account.json` file corresponds to the correct Google Cloud project.\n   - Open the `service_account.json` file and confirm it contains the `\"project_id\"` field. For example:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"type\": \"service_account\",\n       \"project_id\": \"your-project-id\",\n       ...\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Permissions**\n   - The service account must have access to the spreadsheet you're trying to modify. Ensure:\n     - The Google Sheets file is shared with the service account's email (e.g., `your-service-account@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) with **Editor** permissions.\n     - The Google Sheets API is enabled for your project in the Google Cloud Console.\n\n3. **Set the Correct Project in Your Environment**\n   If you are running your code on a local machine or a server, explicitly set the `project_id` in your Google Cloud client configuration. For example:\n   ```python\n   from google.auth import default\n\n   credentials, project_id = default()\n   print(\"Using project:\", project_id)\n   ```\n\n   If the `project_id` is missing or incorrect, you can set it explicitly:\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.environ[\"GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT\"] = \"your-project-id\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Enable Logging API (if necessary)**\n   If your code involves logging or interacting with other APIs like the Stackdriver Logging API, make sure it's enabled in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/).\n\n5. **Double-Check `gspread` Initialization**\n   Ensure you're authenticating properly with `gspread`. Example:\n   ```python\n   import gspread\n\n   # Provide the correct path to your service account key\n   gc = gspread.service_account(filename=\"path/to/service_account.json\")\n\n   # Open the spreadsheet by name\n   spreadsheet = gc.open(\"Your Spreadsheet Name\")\n\n   # Select the worksheet\n   worksheet = spreadsheet.worksheet(\"Your Worksheet Name\")\n   ```\n\n6. **Enable Debugging for gspread**\n   Add debugging to verify the underlying issue:\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n   ```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- If you’re using any additional APIs (like Google Logging), ensure their requests explicitly include the `project_id` in the resource name.\n- Check the scope of the service account:\n   ```json\n   \"scopes\": [\n       \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets\",\n       \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\"\n   ]\n   ```\n\nLet me know if the issue persists after following these steps, and I’ll help troubleshoot further!"

Here's how to resolve the issue:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Validate the `project_id`**\nEnsure you are specifying the `project_id` correctly when querying logs. The resource name must include the project ID explicitly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Correct Code Example**\nHere's a Python example using the `google-cloud-logging` library to query log entries:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import logging\n\n# Initialize the client\nclient = logging.Client(project=\"your-project-id\")\n\n# Define the filter for your log query\nlog_filter = (\n    'resource.type=\"global\" '\n    'logName=\"projects/your-project-id/logs/your-log-name\"'\n)\n\n# Query the log entries\nentries = client.list_entries(filter_=log_filter)\n\n# Process and print the results\nfor entry in entries:\n    print(f\"Timestamp: {entry.timestamp}, Text Payload: {entry.payload}\")\n```\n\nReplace `\"your-project-id\"` and `\"your-log-name\"` with your actual Google Cloud project ID and log name.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Check for Misconfiguration**\n- Ensure your `project_id` is explicitly provided when initializing the `logging.Client`:\n  ```python\n  client = logging.Client(project=\"your-project-id\")\n  ```\n- If you are not passing `project_id`, the client might default to the environment variable `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`. Verify that this environment variable is set correctly:\n  ```bash\n  echo $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Enable the Cloud Logging API**\nEnsure that the **Cloud Logging API** is enabled in your Google Cloud project:\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console API page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).\n2. Search for \"Cloud Logging API.\"\n3. Click \"Enable\" if it’s not already enabled.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Service Account Permissions**\nEnsure the service account you're using has the required roles:\n- **Logs Viewer** (`roles/logging.viewer`) for read-only access.\n- **Logs Writer** (`roles/logging.logWriter`) if you need to write logs.\n\nYou can assign roles in the [IAM page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Valid Log Filters**\nMake sure the filter in `list_entries` has a valid format:\n- Use `resource.type` to specify the monitored resource.\n- Use `logName` to filter by a specific log.\n\nExample of a filter:\n```plaintext\nresource.type=\"global\"\nlogName=\"projects/your-project-id/logs/your-log-name\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Debugging Tips\n- If the issue persists, add debugging to the logging client to verify what's being sent:\n  ```python\n  import logging\n  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n  ```\n\nThis should help identify if the `project_id` is missing in the API request payload.\n\nLet me know if this resolves your issue or if further troubleshooting is needed!"

      "The `403 Permission denied for all resources` error occurs when the service account or user making the request lacks the necessary permissions to access the specified resources. Here's how to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Verify the Service Account Being Used**\nCheck which service account is being used by your application or process. \n\n- For **Cloud Functions**, the default service account is typically:\n  ```\n  [PROJECT_ID]@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\n  ```\n- For **Compute Engine or Cloud Scheduler**, it’s typically:\n  ```\n  [PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Check IAM Role Assignments**\nEnsure the service account has the appropriate roles assigned for the operation being performed.\n\n- Go to the [IAM page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) in the Google Cloud Console.\n- Find the service account and verify it has the required roles. For example:\n  - **Cloud Functions Invoker** (`roles/cloudfunctions.invoker`) for invoking a Cloud Function.\n  - **Logging Viewer** (`roles/logging.viewer`) for accessing logs.\n  - **BigQuery Data Viewer** (`roles/bigquery.dataViewer`) for accessing BigQuery tables.\n\nIf the necessary role is missing, edit the permissions:\n1. Click the **pencil icon** next to the service account.\n2. Add the required role(s).\n3. Save the changes.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Verify Resource-Level Permissions**\nSome roles grant permissions at the resource level (e.g., for a specific bucket or dataset). Make sure permissions are explicitly granted for the resource.\n\n- Example for a Cloud Storage bucket:\n  1. Go to the [Cloud Storage page](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser).\n  2. Select the bucket.\n  3. Click \"Permissions\" and ensure the service account has roles like **Storage Object Viewer**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Test Permissions**\nUse the `gcloud` CLI to test permissions:\n```bash\ngcloud auth list\n```\nEnsure the expected service account is active.\n\nCheck the permissions for the service account:\n```bash\ngcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID]\n```\nReplace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Check for Denials in Audit Logs**\nGoogle Cloud audit logs can help you identify the specific permission that is missing:\n\n1. Go to the [Cloud Logging page](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query).\n2. Search for entries related to `google.iam.policy` or the affected resource.\n3. Look for `PERMISSION_DENIED` logs to identify the missing permission.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Update Cloud Scheduler with Invoker Permissions**\nIf you're scheduling a Cloud Function invocation using **Cloud Scheduler**, the scheduler's service account must have the `Cloud Functions Invoker` role.\n\nAssign the role with this command:\n```bash\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \\\n    --member=\"serviceAccount:[PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com\" \\\n    --role=\"roles/cloudfunctions.invoker\"\n```\n\nReplace:\n- `[PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID.\n- `[PROJECT_NUMBER]` with your project number.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Common Issues**\n- **Role Not Propagated Yet**: If you recently assigned a role, wait a few minutes for the permissions to propagate.\n- **Wrong Service Account**: Double-check that the correct service account is being used in your process.\n- **Missing API Enablement**: Ensure all required APIs are enabled for the project.

      "{\"name\": \"rust_style_guide\", \"type\": \"document\", \"content\": \"# Rust Style Guide\\n\\n## 1. Introduction\\nThis style guide establishes conventions for writing Rust code that is clear, maintainable, and consistent. It is inspired by the principles outlined in the Tcl/Tk Engineering Manual and adapts them to the unique features of Rust.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Code Structure and Organization\\n\\n### 2.1 Project Structure\\n- **Modules:** Organize code into modules (`mod`) to group related functionality.\\n- **File Structure:** Keep each module in its own file where possible. Use a directory structure for nested modules.\\n- **Naming Conventions:**\\n  - Filenames: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `data_processing.rs`).\\n  - Module names: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `data_processing`).\\n\\n### 2.2 Code Layout\\n- Limit lines to **80–100 characters** for readability.\\n- Use **4 spaces** per indentation level.\\n- Separate logical blocks of code with one blank line.\\n- Group related constants, type definitions, and functions together.\\n\\n### 2.3 Comments\\n- **File Headers:** Begin each file with a brief comment summarizing its purpose.\\n- **Module and Function Documentation:**\\n  - Use `///` for public items.\\n  - Use `//!` for module-level documentation.\\n- **Inline Comments:** Use `//` sparingly for explanations within code blocks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Naming Conventions\\n\\n### 3.1 General Guidelines\\n- Use **descriptive names** for variables, functions, and types.\\n- Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known.\\n- Be consistent in naming patterns across similar components.\\n\\n### 3.2 Specific Guidelines\\n- **Constants:** Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.\\n- **Variables:** Use `snake_case`.\\n- **Functions:** Use `snake_case`.\\n- **Structs and Enums:** Use `PascalCase`.\\n- **Traits:** Use `PascalCase` with meaningful names (e.g., `Display`, `Serializable`).\\n- **Lifetimes:** Use short, single-letter names (e.g., `'a`, `'b`) for common cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Coding Practices\\n\\n### 4.1 Functions\\n- Functions should have a single responsibility.\\n- Use **early returns** to reduce nesting.\\n- Use meaningful parameter names to describe their purpose.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\nfn calculate_area(width: f32, height: f32) -> f32 {\\n    width * height\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4.2 Error Handling\\n- Use `Result` and `Option` for error handling.\\n- Prefer `?` syntax for propagating errors.\\n- Include detailed context in errors using crates like `thiserror` or `anyhow`.\\n\\n### 4.3 Ownership and Borrowing\\n- Favor **borrowing** over cloning or moving unless ownership is required.\\n- Explicitly document the ownership model in complex cases.\\n\\n### 4.4 Iterators and Collections\\n- Use iterators for collection processing instead of manual loops.\\n- Use expressive iterator combinators like `map`, `filter`, and `fold`.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\nlet squares: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|n| n * n).collect();\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Style and Formatting\\n\\n### 5.1 Use of `rustfmt`\\n- Use `rustfmt` to automatically format code.\\n- Configure `rustfmt` in `rustfmt.toml` for project-specific preferences.\\n\\n### 5.2 Imports\\n- Group `use` statements:\\n  - Standard library imports first.\\n  - External crate imports second.\\n  - Internal module imports last.\\n- Use `self::` for internal module paths.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\\nuse serde::Serialize;\\nuse crate::utils::parse_data;\\n```\\n\\n### 5.3 Attributes\\n- Place attributes (`#[derive]`, `#[test]`, etc.) on the line immediately above the item.\\n- Use multi-line formatting for attributes with multiple arguments.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\\nstruct Point {\\n    x: f32,\\n    y: f32,\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Testing\\n\\n### 6.1 Unit Tests\\n- Write unit tests for all public functions.\\n- Place tests in a `mod tests` block within the same file.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\n#[cfg(test)]\\nmod tests {\\n    use super::*;\\n\\n    #[test]\\n    fn test_calculate_area() {\\n        assert_eq!(calculate_area(2.0, 3.0), 6.0);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 6.2 Integration Tests\\n- Place integration tests in the `tests/` directory.\\n- Use descriptive filenames and group related tests together.\\n\\n### 6.3 Test Coverage\\n- Aim for high test coverage but prioritize testing critical paths.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Unsafe Code\\n\\n- Use `unsafe` sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.\\n- Encapsulate unsafe code in functions with clear and well-documented safety contracts.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\n/// # Safety\\n/// Caller must ensure that `ptr` is valid and properly aligned.\\nunsafe fn deref_raw_pointer(ptr: *const i32) -> i32 {\\n    *ptr\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8. Documentation\\n\\n### 8.1 Public API Documentation\\n- Use `///` comments to document all public types, traits, and functions.\\n- Include examples in the documentation when possible.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\n/// Calculates the area of a rectangle.\\n///\\n/// # Arguments\\n///\\n/// * `width` - The width of the rectangle.\\n/// * `height` - The height of the rectangle.\\n///\\n/// # Examples\\n///\\n/// ```\\n/// let area = calculate_area(2.0, 3.0);\\n/// assert_eq!(area, 6.0);\\n/// ```\\nfn calculate_area(width: f32, height: f32) -> f32 {\\n    width * height\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 8.2 Internal Documentation\\n- Use inline comments (`//`) to explain complex or non-obvious code.\\n- Avoid redundant comments that restate obvious code behavior.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9.

Introduction\\nThis style guide establishes conventions for writing Rust code that is clear, maintainable, and consistent. It is inspired by the principles outlined in the Tcl/Tk Engineering Manual and adapts them to the unique features of Rust.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Code Structure and Organization\\n\\n### 2.1 Project Structure\\n- **Modules:** Organize code into modules (`mod`) to group related functionality.\\n- **File Structure:** Keep each module in its own file where possible. Use a directory structure for nested modules.\\n- **Naming Conventions:**\\n  - Filenames: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `data_processing.rs`).\\n  - Module names: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `data_processing`).\\n\\n### 2.2 Code Layout\\n- Limit lines to **80–100 characters** for readability.\\n- Use **4 spaces** per indentation level.\\n- Separate logical blocks of code with one blank line.\\n- Group related constants, type definitions, and functions together.\\n\\n### 2.3 Comments\\n- **File Headers:** Begin each file with a brief comment summarizing its purpose.\\n- **Module and Function Documentation:**\\n  - Use `///` for public items.\\n  - Use `//!` for module-level documentation.\\n- **Inline Comments:** Use `//` sparingly for explanations within code blocks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Naming Conventions\\n\\n### 3.1 General Guidelines\\n- Use **descriptive names** for variables, functions, and types.\\n- Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known.\\n- Be consistent in naming patterns across similar components.\\n\\n### 3.2 Specific Guidelines\\n- **Constants:** Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.\\n- **Variables:** Use `snake_case`.\\n- **Functions:** Use `snake_case`.\\n- **Structs and Enums:** Use `PascalCase`.\\n- **Traits:** Use `PascalCase` with meaningful names (e.g., `Display`, `Serializable`).\\n- **Lifetimes:** Use short, single-letter names (e.g., `'a`, `'b`) for common cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Coding Practices\\n\\n### 4.1 Functions\\n- Functions should have a single responsibility.\\n- Use **early returns** to reduce nesting.\\n- Use meaningful parameter names to describe their purpose.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\nfn calculate_area(width: f32, height: f32) -> f32 {\\n    width * height\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4.2 Error Handling\\n- Use `Result` and `Option` for error handling.\\n- Prefer `?` syntax for propagating errors.\\n- Include detailed context in errors using crates like `thiserror` or `anyhow`.\\n\\n### 4.3 Ownership and Borrowing\\n- Favor **borrowing** over cloning or moving unless ownership is required.\\n- Explicitly document the ownership model in complex cases.\\n\\n### 4.4 Iterators and Collections\\n- Use iterators for collection processing instead of manual loops.\\n- Use expressive iterator combinators like `map`, `filter`, and `fold`.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\nlet squares: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|n| n * n).collect();\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Style and Formatting\\n\\n### 5.1 Use of `rustfmt`\\n- Use `rustfmt` to automatically format code.\\n- Configure `rustfmt` in `rustfmt.toml` for project-specific preferences.\\n\\n### 5.2 Imports\\n- Group `use` statements:\\n  - Standard library imports first.\\n  - External crate imports second.\\n  - Internal module imports last.\\n- Use `self::` for internal module paths.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\\nuse serde::Serialize;\\nuse crate::utils::parse_data;\\n```\\n\\n### 5.3 Attributes\\n- Place attributes (`#[derive]`, `#[test]`, etc.) on the line immediately above the item.\\n- Use multi-line formatting for attributes with multiple arguments.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\\nstruct Point {\\n    x: f32,\\n    y: f32,\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Testing\\n\\n### 6.1 Unit Tests\\n- Write unit tests for all public functions.\\n- Place tests in a `mod tests` block within the same file.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\n#[cfg(test)]\\nmod tests {\\n    use super::*;\\n\\n    #[test]\\n    fn test_calculate_area() {\\n        assert_eq!(calculate_area(2.0, 3.0), 6.0);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 6.2 Integration Tests\\n- Place integration tests in the `tests/` directory.\\n- Use descriptive filenames and group related tests together.\\n\\n### 6.3 Test Coverage\\n- Aim for high test coverage but prioritize testing critical paths.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Unsafe Code\\n\\n- Use `unsafe` sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.\\n- Encapsulate unsafe code in functions with clear and well-documented safety contracts.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\n/// # Safety\\n/// Caller must ensure that `ptr` is valid and properly aligned.\\nunsafe fn deref_raw_pointer(ptr: *const i32) -> i32 {\\n    *ptr\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8. Documentation\\n\\n### 8.1 Public API Documentation\\n- Use `///` comments to document all public types, traits, and functions.\\n- Include examples in the documentation when possible.\\n\\n#### Example\\n```rust\\n/// Calculates the area of a rectangle.\\n///\\n/// # Arguments\\n///\\n/// * `width` - The width of the rectangle.\\n/// * `height` - The height of the rectangle.\\n///\\n/// # Examples\\n///\\n/// ```\\n/// let area = calculate_area(2.0, 3.0);\\n/// assert_eq!(area, 6.0);\\n/// ```\\nfn calculate_area(width: f32, height: f32) -> f32 {\\n    width * height\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 8.2 Internal Documentation\\n- Use inline comments (`//`) to explain complex or non-obvious code.\\n- Avoid redundant comments that restate obvious code behavior.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9. Dependencies\\n\\n- Use dependencies sparingly and prefer well-maintained and widely-used crates.\\n- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities and updates.\\n- Pin versions in the `Cargo.toml` to ensure reproducibility.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 10. Performance and Optimization\\n\\n- Write clear, maintainable code first; optimize only after profiling.\\n- Use Rust's powerful profiling tools (e.g., `cargo-flamegraph`).\\n- Avoid premature optimization that sacrifices code readability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 11.

Introduction\\n\\nThis style guide establishes conventions for writing Rust code that is clear, maintainable, and consistent. It is inspired by the principles outlined in the Tcl/Tk Engineering Manual and adapts them to the unique features of Rust.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Code Structure and Organization\\n\\n### 2.1 Project Structure\\n- **Modules:** Organize code into modules (`mod`) to group related functionality.\\n- **File Structure:** Keep each module in its own file where possible. Use a directory structure for nested modules.\\n- **Naming Conventions:**\\n  - Filenames: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `data_processing.rs`).\\n  - Module names: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `data_processing`).\\n\\n### 2.2 Code Layout\\n- Limit lines to **80–100 characters** for readability.\\n- Use **4 spaces** per indentation level.\\n- Separate logical blocks of code with one blank line.\\n- Group related constants, type definitions, and functions together.\\n\\n### 2.3 Comments\\n- **File Headers:** Begin each file with a brief comment summarizing its purpose.\\n- **Module and Function Documentation:**\\n  - Use `///` for public items.\\n  - Use `//!` for module-level documentation.\\n- **Inline Comments:** Use `//` sparingly for explanations within code blocks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Naming Conventions\\n\\n### 3.1 General Guidelines\\n- Use **descriptive names** for variables, functions, and types.\\n- Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known.\\n- Be consistent in naming patterns across similar components.\\n\\n### 3.2 Specific Guidelines\\n- **Constants:** Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.\\n- **Variables:** Use `snake_case`.\\n- **Functions:** Use `snake_case`.\\n- **Structs and Enums:** Use `PascalCase`.\\n- **Traits:** Use `PascalCase` with meaningful names (e.g., `Display`, `Serializable`).\\n- **Lifetimes:** Use short, single-letter names (e.g., `'a`, `'b`) for common cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Coding Practices\\n\\n### 4.1 Functions\\n- Functions should have a single responsibility.\\n- Use **early returns** to reduce nesting.\\n- Use meaningful parameter names to describe their purpose.\\n\\n```rust\\nfn calculate_area(width: f32, height: f32) -> f32 {\\n    width * height\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4.2 Error Handling\\n- Use `Result` and `Option` for error handling.\\n- Prefer `?` syntax for propagating errors.\\n- Include detailed context in errors using crates like `thiserror` or `anyhow`.\\n\\n### 4.3 Ownership and Borrowing\\n- Favor **borrowing** over cloning or moving unless ownership is required.\\n- Explicitly document the ownership model in complex cases.\\n\\n### 4.4 Iterators and Collections\\n- Use iterators for collection processing instead of manual loops.\\n- Use expressive iterator combinators like `map`, `filter`, and `fold`.\\n\\n```rust\\nlet squares: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|n| n * n).collect();\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Style and Formatting\\n\\n### 5.1 Use of `rustfmt`\\n- Use `rustfmt` to automatically format code.\\n- Configure `rustfmt` in `rustfmt.toml` for project-specific preferences.\\n\\n### 5.2 Imports\\n- Group `use` statements:\\n  - Standard library imports first.\\n  - External crate imports second.\\n  - Internal module imports last.\\n\\n```rust\\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\\nuse serde::Serialize;\\nuse crate::utils::parse_data;\\n```\\n\\n### 5.3 Attributes\\n- Place attributes (`#[derive]`, `#[test]`, etc.) on the line immediately above the item.\\n- Use multi-line formatting for attributes with multiple arguments.\\n\\n```rust\\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\\nstruct Point {\\n    x: f32,\\n    y: f32,\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Testing\\n\\n### 6.1 Unit Tests\\n- Write unit tests for all public functions.\\n- Place tests in a `mod tests` block within the same file.\\n\\n```rust\\n#[cfg(test)]\\nmod tests {\\n    use super::*;\\n\\n    #[test]\\n    fn test_calculate_area() {\\n        assert_eq!(calculate_area(2.0, 3.0), 6.0);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 6.2 Integration Tests\\n- Place integration tests in the `tests/` directory.\\n- Use descriptive filenames and group related tests together.\\n\\n### 6.3 Test Coverage\\n- Aim for high test coverage but prioritize testing critical paths.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Unsafe Code\\n\\n- Use `unsafe` sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.\\n- Encapsulate unsafe code in functions with clear and well-documented safety contracts.\\n\\n```rust\\n/// Safety\\n///\\n/// Caller must ensure that `ptr` is valid and properly aligned.\\nunsafe fn deref_raw_pointer(ptr: *const i32) -> i32 {\\n    *ptr\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8. Documentation\\n\\n### 8.1 Public API Documentation\\n- Use `///` comments to document all public types, traits, and functions.\\n- Include examples in the documentation when possible.\\n\\n```rust\\n/// Calculates the area of a rectangle.\\n///\\n/// Arguments:\\n///\\n/// * `width` - The width of the rectangle.\\n/// * `height` - The height of the rectangle.\\n///\\n/// Examples:\\n///\\n/// ```\\n/// let area = calculate_area(2.0, 3.0);\\n/// assert_eq!(area, 6.0);\\n/// ```\\nfn calculate_area(width: f32, height: f32) -> f32 {\\n    width * height\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 8.2 Internal Documentation\\n- Use inline comments (`//`) to explain complex or non-obvious code.\\n- Avoid redundant comments that restate obvious code behavior.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9. Dependencies\\n\\n- Use dependencies sparingly and prefer well-maintained and widely-used crates.\\n- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities and updates.\\n- Pin versions in the `Cargo.toml` to ensure reproducibility.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 10. Performance and Optimization\\n\\n- Write clear, maintainable code first; optimize only after profiling.\\n- Use Rust's powerful profiling tools (e.g., `cargo-flamegraph`).\\n- Avoid premature optimization that sacrifices code readability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 11. Community Standards\\n\\n- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).\\n- Participate in code reviews and encourage constructive feedback.\\n- Contribute back to the Rust ecosystem by reporting bugs and submitting patches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 12. Conclusion\\n\\nAdhering to this style guide will ensure that Rust codebases remain consistent, maintainable, and aligned with the language's best practices. Regularly revisit and refine these guidelines to adapt to new developments in the Rust ecosystem.\"}]}"
