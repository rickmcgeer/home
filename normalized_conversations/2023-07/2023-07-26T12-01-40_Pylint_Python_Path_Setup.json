      "To configure Pylint in Visual Studio Code to use a specific directory as the parent directory for the modules you are importing, you can set the Python path in your workspace settings. The Python path tells Pylint where to look for modules when it analyzes your code for linting and code analysis. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open your Visual Studio Code workspace (or create one if you don't have it yet).\n\n2. In the root folder of your workspace, create a `.vscode` folder if it doesn't exist.\n\n3. Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a `settings.json` file if it doesn't exist. This file will contain your workspace-specific settings.\n\n4. In `settings.json`, add the following configuration to set the Python path:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"python.pythonPath\": \"/path/to/your/python\",\n  \"python.autoComplete.addBrackets\": true,\n  \"python.linting.pylintArgs\": [\"--init-hook\", \"import sys; sys.path.append('/workspace/dataplane/data_plane')\"]\n}\n```\n\nHere's what each setting does:\n\n- `\"python.pythonPath\"`: Set this to the path of your Python interpreter. You can find the path by running `which python` in your terminal (for Linux/macOS) or `where python` (for Windows).\n\n- `\"python.autoComplete.addBrackets\"`: This is an optional setting that adds brackets when autocompleting function calls.\n\n- `\"python.linting.pylintArgs\"`: This setting allows you to pass additional arguments to Pylint. In this case, we use the `--init-hook` argument to execute a Python statement before running Pylint. The statement appends the desired path to the `sys.path` list so that Pylint will consider it when looking for modules.\n\n5. Replace `/path/to/your/python` with the actual path to your Python interpreter.\n\n6. Replace `/workspace/dataplane/data_plane` with the desired parent directory path for the modules you are importing.\n\n7. Save the `settings.json` file.\n\nAfter configuring the Python path, Pylint should be able to find the modules imported from the specified directory, and the linting and code analysis should work accordingly."
