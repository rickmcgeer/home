      "Once a user is authenticated with Google OAuth, their session token will contain user information, including their email and profile details. You can extract this data from the token stored in the Flask session.\n\n### **Steps to Get the User Info**\n1. **Ensure OAuth stores the token in the session**  \n   After successful authentication, Google returns an access token. This token is stored in `session['user']`.\n\n2. **Extract the User Info**\n   You can retrieve the authenticated user's details like this:\n   ```python\n   from flask import session\n\n   @app.route('/profile')\n   def profile():\n       if 'user' not in session:\n           return \"User not logged in\", 401\n\n       user_info = session['user']  # Contains token and user data\n       email = user_info.get('userinfo', {}).get('email', 'Unknown')\n       name = user_info.get('userinfo', {}).get('name', 'Unknown')\n\n       return f\"Logged in as: {name} ({email})\"\n   ```\n\n### **Verifying the Token**\nIf you need to fetch fresh user info, you can use the access token to make a request to Google's user info endpoint:\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_user_info():\n    if 'user' not in session:\n        return None\n\n    token = session['user']['access_token']\n    response = requests.get(\n        'https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo',\n        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}\n    )\n    return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None\n```\n\n### **Example User Data**\nWhen logged in, `session['user']` should contain a structure like this:\n```json\n{\n    \"access_token\": \"ya29.a0AfH6SM...\",\n    \"expires_in\": 3599,\n    \"scope\": \"openid email\",\n    \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",\n    \"userinfo\": {\n        \"email\": \"user@example.com\",\n        \"verified_email\": true,\n        \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"picture\": \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14...\",\n        \"locale\": \"en\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWould you like help securing session storage to protect user data?"

Check If `authlib` is Installed**\nRun this in the VS Code terminal to verify that `authlib` is available in the currently selected environment:\n```sh\npython -m pip show authlib\n```\nIf it's not installed, install it explicitly in the environment:\n```sh\npython -m pip install authlib\n```\n\n### **3.

      "The error **\"invalid_grant: Bad Request\"** typically means that your authentication credentials are incorrect or expired. Here’s how to fix it:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Check Your Authentication Method**\nSince you’re using `google.cloud.storage.Client()`, ensure your credentials are properly set up.\n\n#### **A. If Using Application Default Credentials (ADC)**\nTry running:\n```sh\ngcloud auth application-default login\n```\nThis will authenticate your local environment and allow the Cloud Storage client to use the correct credentials.\n\n#### **B. If Using a Service Account**\nIf your app is using a **service account JSON key**, set it explicitly:\n```python\nimport os\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\nos.environ[\"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\"] = \"path/to/your-service-account.json\"\n\nclient = storage.Client()\nbucket = client.bucket('battery-data')\nblob = bucket.blob('write-test.txt')\n\nwith blob.open(mode='w') as f:\n    f.write('Hello, world\\n')\n\nprint('Blob written')\n```\nMake sure the service account has **Storage Object Admin** or **Storage Admin** permissions.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ensure Your Credentials Are Not Expired**\nIf your credentials are stored in a file but expired or corrupted:\n- Re-authenticate:  \n  ```sh\n  gcloud auth application-default login\n  ```\n- If using a service account, **download a new JSON key** from **Google Cloud Console**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Verify the Target Bucket and Object Path**\n- Ensure **\"battery-data\"** is the correct bucket name.\n- Remove the leading `/` in `blob = bucket.blob('/tmp/write-test.txt')`, it should be:\n  ```python\n  blob = bucket.blob('tmp/write-test.txt')\n  ```\n  Google Cloud Storage **does not use absolute paths** like a traditional filesystem.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Test Credentials With `gsutil`**\nTo check if your credentials are valid, try:\n```sh\ngsutil ls gs://battery-data/\n```\nIf this fails, your authentication needs fixing.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Restart Your Environment**\n- If you’ve made changes, restart your VS Code terminal.\n- If you’re using a virtual environment, deactivate/reactivate it.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\nTry these fixes and let me know if you still get the error! 🚀"

      "To use **Application Default Credentials (ADC)** in a Python program, follow these steps:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Authenticate Locally Using gcloud**\nBefore running your Python program, ensure that your local environment is authenticated with ADC:  \n```sh\ngcloud auth application-default login\n```\nThis command:\n- Opens a browser for Google login.\n- Saves credentials to `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Use ADC in Python Code**\nYou don’t need to manually set credentials; the **Google Cloud Client Libraries** will automatically use ADC.\n\n#### **Example: Using ADC with Google Cloud Storage**\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\n# Create a client (automatically picks up ADC)\nclient = storage.Client()\n\n# Specify the bucket\nbucket = client.bucket('your-bucket-name')\n\n# Create a blob (file) and write to it\nblob = bucket.blob('write-test.txt')\n\nwith blob.open(mode='w') as f:\n    f.write('Hello, world\\n')\n\nprint('Blob written successfully!')\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Ensure the Correct Google Cloud Project**\nIf you have multiple Google Cloud projects, specify one explicitly:\n```python\nclient = storage.Client(project=\"your-project-id\")\n```\nAlternatively, set the project in the CLI:\n```sh\ngcloud config set project your-project-id\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Test Your Credentials**\nCheck if ADC is working by running:\n```sh\ngcloud auth application-default print-access-token\n```\nThis should return an access token without errors.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Deploying to Cloud**\nWhen running on **Google Cloud services** (App Engine, Cloud Run, GKE, etc.), ADC will automatically use the **service account** attached to the resource. No need for manual authentication.\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ **Summary**\n- Run `gcloud auth application-default login` (for local testing).\n- Use `google.cloud` libraries in Python (ADC will auto-detect credentials).\n- Ensure the correct project is set.\n- Works automatically on Google Cloud.\n\nTry it and let me know if you hit any issues! 🚀"
