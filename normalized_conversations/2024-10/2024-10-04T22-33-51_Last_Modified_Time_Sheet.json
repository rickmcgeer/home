      "Unfortunately, Google Sheets API doesn't directly provide a method to retrieve the last modified time of an individual sheet (tab) within a Google Sheets workbook. The `lastModifiedTime` property applies to the entire spreadsheet, not specific sheets within it.\n\nHowever, there are some workarounds you can consider:\n\n### Option 1: Use Google Apps Script to Track Changes\nYou can use Google Apps Script to track changes to individual sheets by setting up an `onEdit` trigger. This script would log the timestamp of any changes to a specific sheet.\n\nHere's an example script that logs the last modified time of a specific sheet:\n\n```javascript\nfunction onEdit(e) {\n  var sheet = e.source.getActiveSheet(); // Get the active sheet where the edit happened\n  var logSheetName = \"LogSheet\"; // Create a sheet to store the last modified time\n\n  if (sheet.getName() === \"Sheet1\") { // Replace 'Sheet1' with your target sheet name\n    var logSheet = e.source.getSheetByName(logSheetName); \n    if (!logSheet) {\n      logSheet = e.source.insertSheet(logSheetName); // Create the log sheet if it doesn't exist\n    }\n    logSheet.getRange(1, 1).setValue(\"Last modified time for Sheet1:\");\n    logSheet.getRange(1, 2).setValue(new Date()); // Store the current date and time\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n- The `onEdit` trigger runs every time you make an edit in the Google Sheets workbook.\n- If the edit happens in `Sheet1`, the script logs the current date and time in the `LogSheet`.\n- You can replace `\"Sheet1\"` with the name of the sheet you want to monitor.\n\n### Option 2: Manual Inspection of Revision History\nIf you need to manually check the last modification time of a specific sheet, you can do so via:\n1. **Google Sheets Version History**: Go to `File` → `Version history` → `See version history`. This will show you the times of changes across the entire spreadsheet, but not for individual sheets.\n\nThese are your options to work around the lack of a direct API method for this functionality."
