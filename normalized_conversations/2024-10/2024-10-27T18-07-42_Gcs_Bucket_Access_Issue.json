By default, `upload_from_file` replaces any file that already exists at the specified path (`destination_blob_name`).\n\nIf you'd like to avoid overwriting an existing file, you can add a check to see if the blob already exists before uploading. Here’s how to modify the code to prevent overwriting:\n\n```python\n# Check if blob exists\nif blob.exists(client):\n    print(f\"Blob {destination_blob_name} already exists in {bucket_name}. Aborting upload.\")\nelse:\n    # Upload the Parquet file to GCS\n    blob.upload_from_file(parquet_buffer, content_type='application/octet-stream')\n    print(f'File uploaded to {bucket_name}/{destination_blob_name}')\n```\n\nThis check will allow the upload only if there is no existing blob with the same name."

Click on the domain name you want to edit.\n\n3. **Go to DNS Settings:**\n   - In the sidebar, select **DNS** to open the DNS settings page.\n\n4. **Add an A Record:**\n   - Scroll down to the **Custom resource records** section.\n   - In the first field, enter the **subdomain** (or leave it blank to use the root domain).\n   - In the **Type** dropdown, select **A**.\n   - In the **TTL** field, leave it as the default (usually 1 hour) or set a different TTL.\n   - In the **IPv4 address** field, enter the IP address where you want the domain to point.\n   - Click **Add** to save the record.\n\n5. **Save and Test:**\n   - Google Domains should automatically save the record after you click **Add**.\n   - DNS changes may take a few minutes to propagate, so wait a few minutes, then test your domain by pinging it or opening it in a browser.\n\nYour domain should now point to the IP address specified in the A record.
