      "To get a list of collaborators on a Google Doc or Google Sheet in plaintext or JSON form, you can use the Google Drive API to retrieve the list of permissions (which includes users with access to the file). Here's how you can do this:\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Set Up Google Drive API:**\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n   - Create a new project or select an existing project.\n   - Enable the **Google Drive API** for your project.\n   - Create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** for your project and download the `credentials.json` file.\n   - Install the `google-auth` and `googleapiclient` Python libraries if needed:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client\n     ```\n\n2. **Authenticate and Access the File:**\n   Using Python, authenticate and access the file's permissions to retrieve the collaborators.\n\n3. **Code to Get Collaborators:**\n\n   Here's a Python script that retrieves the list of collaborators for a specific file:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.oauth2 import service_account\n   from googleapiclient.discovery import build\n\n   # Path to your service account key file\n   SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'path_to_service_account_key.json'\n   \n   # Scopes required to access Google Drive API\n   SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly']\n   \n   # Authenticate using service account\n   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(\n       SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)\n\n   # Build the Drive API client\n   service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=credentials)\n\n   # File ID of the Google Doc or Sheet\n   FILE_ID = 'your-file-id-here'\n\n   # Get the list of permissions for the file\n   permissions = service.permissions().list(fileId=FILE_ID).execute()\n\n   # Extract the list of collaborators (permissions)\n   collaborators = permissions.get('permissions', [])\n\n   # Print the list in plaintext\n   for collaborator in collaborators:\n       print(f\"Role: {collaborator['role']}, Email: {collaborator.get('emailAddress', 'N/A')}\")\n\n   # Print the list as JSON\n   import json\n   print(json.dumps(collaborators, indent=2))\n   ```\n\n   Replace `path_to_service_account_key.json` with the path to your service account key, and `your-file-id-here` with the actual Google Doc or Google Sheet ID.\n\n### Output:\n\nThe script will output the list of collaborators, showing their roles (e.g., owner, writer, reader) and email addresses. The collaborators will be listed both in plaintext and in JSON form.\n\n### Example JSON Output:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"permission-id-1\",\n    \"role\": \"writer\",\n    \"type\": \"user\",\n    \"emailAddress\": \"collaborator1@example.com\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"permission-id-2\",\n    \"role\": \"reader\",\n    \"type\": \"user\",\n    \"emailAddress\": \"collaborator2@example.com\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis approach requires you to have the necessary access to the Google Doc or Sheet and the appropriate permissions to use the Google Drive API."

Apps Script provides a way to interact with Google services, including Google Drive, using simple JavaScript.\n\nHere’s how you can retrieve the list of collaborators using Apps Script:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Create a New Google Apps Script Project**:\n   - Open the Google Sheet or Doc for which you want to list collaborators.\n   - Go to **Extensions > Apps Script**.\n   - This will open the Apps Script editor.\n\n2. **Write the Script to Retrieve Collaborators**:\n   Use the following script to get the list of collaborators (editors, readers, owners) for the current Google Sheet or Doc.\n\n   ```javascript\n   function getCollaborators() {\n     // Get the active document or sheet (this works for both Google Docs and Sheets)\n     var file = DriveApp.getFileById(SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getId());\n     \n     // For Google Docs, you can use this instead:\n     // var file = DriveApp.getFileById(DocumentApp.getActiveDocument().getId());\n\n     // Get the list of editors (collaborators with edit access)\n     var editors = file.getEditors();\n     // Get the list of viewers (collaborators with view access)\n     var viewers = file.getViewers();\n     // Get the owner\n     var owner = file.getOwner();\n\n     // Create an array to store the collaborators' information\n     var collaborators = [];\n\n     // Add the owner\n     collaborators.push({\n       'role': 'owner',\n       'email': owner.getEmail(),\n       'name': owner.getName()\n     });\n\n     // Add the editors\n     editors.forEach(function(editor) {\n       collaborators.push({\n         'role': 'editor',\n         'email': editor.getEmail(),\n         'name': editor.getName()\n       });\n     });\n\n     // Add the viewers\n     viewers.forEach(function(viewer) {\n       collaborators.push({\n         'role': 'viewer',\n         'email': viewer.getEmail(),\n         'name': viewer.getName()\n       });\n     });\n\n     // Log the collaborators list in JSON format\n     Logger.log(JSON.stringify(collaborators, null, 2));\n\n     // If you want to return the list in plaintext form\n     collaborators.forEach(function(collaborator) {\n       Logger.log(\"Role: \" + collaborator.role + \", Email: \" + collaborator.email + \", Name: \" + collaborator.name);\n     });\n\n     return collaborators;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Script**:\n   - After saving the script, click the **Run** button.\n   - The first time you run the script, it will ask for authorization. Approve the required permissions.\n   - Once the script runs, check the **Logs** (from **View > Logs**) to see the list of collaborators.\n\n### Output:\n\n- The script will output a list of collaborators (owners, editors, viewers) along with their emails and names.\n- The list is also logged in JSON format, so you can easily copy it.\n\n### Example JSON Output:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"owner\",\n    \"email\": \"owner@example.com\",\n    \"name\": \"Owner Name\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"editor\",\n    \"email\": \"editor1@example.com\",\n    \"name\": \"Editor One\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"viewer\",\n    \"email\": \"viewer1@example.com\",\n    \"name\": \"Viewer One\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis method works well for Google Docs or Sheets, and you can extend it to handle specific cases as needed. If you want to store or process the list further, you can modify the script to email the list, save it to a file, or export it in another format."

      "To meet your requirements—a server-side file browser that interacts with a Flask backend (or Node.js) and replicates the functionality of the Windows File Browser—there are a few JavaScript libraries that can work well with Flask and provide similar file browsing and management capabilities.\n\nHere's a solution combining Flask with a capable file browser library:\n\n### Recommended File Browsing Widgets for Flask Integration\n\n1. **ElFinder** (Open-source, highly customizable)\n   - **Capabilities**: Provides a Windows Explorer-like UI with full file management capabilities, such as browsing, creating directories, uploading, renaming, and deleting files. It also supports drag-and-drop functionality.\n   - **Back-end Integration**: Although it has backends in PHP and Node.js, you can use a custom Flask backend to handle file operations using RESTful endpoints.\n\n   #### Flask + ElFinder Setup:\n\n   1. **Frontend (ElFinder)**:\n      You can use ElFinder’s JavaScript library on the front end to build the interface.\n\n      ```html\n      <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n      <script src=\"path/to/elfinder/js/elfinder.min.js\"></script>\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/elfinder/css/elfinder.min.css\">\n\n      <div id=\"elfinder\"></div>\n\n      <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        $(document).ready(function() {\n          $('#elfinder').elfinder({\n            // Set the URL to your Flask backend for file management\n            url: '/file/connector'\n          });\n        });\n      </script>\n      ```\n\n   2. **Backend (Flask)**:\n      Create a Flask route to handle file operations (browsing, uploading, deleting, etc.).\n\n      ```python\n      from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n      import os\n\n      app = Flask(__name__)\n\n      BASE_DIR = \"/path/to/your/files\"\n\n      @app.route('/file/connector', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n      def file_connector():\n          # ElFinder connector implementation for Flask\n\n          # Handle file browsing, uploading, renaming, deleting here\n          if request.method == 'GET':\n              # Handle file listing logic here, e.g., os.listdir(BASE_DIR)\n              files = os.listdir(BASE_DIR)\n              return jsonify(files)  # Return the file list in JSON\n\n          elif request.method == 'POST':\n              # Handle file upload, delete, etc. operations here\n              if 'upload' in request.files:\n                  file = request.files['upload']\n                  file.save(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, file.filename))\n                  return jsonify(success=True)\n\n          return jsonify(success=False)\n\n      if __name__ == '__main__':\n          app.run(debug=True)\n      ```\n\n   - **ElFinder** provides multiple operations (browsing, renaming, deleting, uploading) that can be mapped to Flask routes.\n   - **URL Structure**: Configure ElFinder to call the `/file/connector` Flask route for file operations.\n\n   **Why ElFinder?**\n   - It offers a powerful, Windows-like file browsing UI with full management capabilities.\n   - You can easily map it to a Flask backend by handling requests for file operations using Python's `os` or `shutil` modules.\n   - Full customization support for directory and file access control.\n\n2. **RichFileManager** (Lightweight and Flask-compatible)\n   - **Capabilities**: Similar to ElFinder, it provides a UI for browsing, uploading, renaming, and deleting files. It has a more modern design and simpler setup.\n   - **Back-end Integration**: It offers customizable connectors for different backends, including Flask.\n\n   #### Flask + RichFileManager Setup:\n\n   1. **Frontend (RichFileManager)**:\n      You can include the RichFileManager widget on the front end.\n\n      ```html\n      <script src=\"path/to/richfilemanager/scripts/filemanager.min.js\"></script>\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/richfilemanager/styles/filemanager.min.css\">\n\n      <div id=\"filemanager\"></div>\n\n      <script>\n        $('#filemanager').richFilemanager({\n          config: '/path/to/filemanager.config.json',  // Set config path\n          apiConnectorUrl: '/file/connector'  // Set Flask backend URL\n        });\n      </script>\n      ```\n\n   2. **Backend (Flask)**:\n      Implement a simple Flask backend to handle file management operations, similar to the ElFinder setup.\n\n      ```python\n      from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n      import os\n\n      app = Flask(__name__)\n\n      BASE_DIR = \"/path/to/your/files\"\n\n      @app.route('/file/connector', methods=['POST'])\n      def file_connector():\n          # Implement your file browsing, uploading, renaming, and deleting logic here\n          return jsonify({ 'success': True, 'files': os.listdir(BASE_DIR) })\n\n      if __name__ == '__main__':\n          app.run(debug=True)\n      ```\n\n   **Why RichFileManager?**\n   - It’s a lightweight and more modern alternative to ElFinder.\n   - Easy integration with Flask for file browsing and manipulation.\n   - It offers a simple UI that feels like a modern file explorer.\n\n3. **Flask-FileManager** (Simpler, Flask-specific solution)\n   - **Capabilities**: Provides basic file management operations like listing, uploading, and deleting files, but with a simpler UI compared to the Windows File Explorer.\n   - **Back-end Integration**: Direct integration with Flask using RESTful APIs for file management.\n\n   #### Flask-FileManager Setup:\n   \n   - Install the library: `pip install flask-filemanager`\n   \n   - Create a basic Flask app using the `Flask-FileManager` extension:\n\n     ```python\n     from flask import Flask\n     from flask_filemanager import FileManager\n\n     app = Flask(__name__)\n     file_manager = FileManager(app)\n\n     app.config['FILEMANAGER_FILE_PATH'] = '/path/to/your/files'  # Set file path\n\n     @app.route('/')\n     def index():\n         return file_manager.render_file_manager()\n\n     if __name__ == '__main__':\n         app.run(debug=True)\n     ```\n\n   - **Why Flask-FileManager?**\n     - It's purpose-built for Flask and provides a simplified file browser interface.\n     - It's perfect for users looking for a basic file manager without the complexity of a full UI like ElFinder or RichFileManager.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **For full Windows File Browser-like functionality**: Go with **ElFinder** for the most extensive capabilities and full control over file operations.\n- **For a simpler and more modern UI**: Use **RichFileManager** for a lightweight experience.\n- **For minimal setup and direct Flask support**: Consider **Flask-FileManager**, which is easy to integrate but lacks some of the advanced UI features of other tools.\n\nEach of these libraries can be set up with a Flask backend, allowing full control over the file system with a modern, browser-based interface that mimics desktop file explorers."

It has a more modern design and simpler setup.\n   - **Back-end Integration**: It offers customizable connectors for different backends, including Flask.\n\n   #### Flask + RichFileManager Setup:\n\n   1. **Frontend (RichFileManager)**:\n      You can include the RichFileManager widget on the front end.\n\n      ```html\n      <script src=\"path/to/richfilemanager/scripts/filemanager.min.js\"></script>\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/richfilemanager/styles/filemanager.min.css\">\n\n      <div id=\"filemanager\"></div>\n\n      <script>\n        $('#filemanager').richFilemanager({\n          config: '/path/to/filemanager.config.json',  // Set config path\n          apiConnectorUrl: '/file/connector'  // Set Flask backend URL\n        });\n      </script>\n      ```\n\n   2. **Backend (Flask)**:\n      Implement a simple Flask backend to handle file management operations, similar to the ElFinder setup.\n\n      ```python\n      from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n      import os\n\n      app = Flask(__name__)\n\n      BASE_DIR = \"/path/to/your/files\"\n\n      @app.route('/file/connector', methods=['POST'])\n      def file_connector():\n          # Implement your file browsing, uploading, renaming, and deleting logic here\n          return jsonify({ 'success': True, 'files': os.listdir(BASE_DIR) })\n\n      if __name__ == '__main__':\n          app.run(debug=True)\n      ```\n\n   **Why RichFileManager?**\n   - It’s a lightweight and more modern alternative to ElFinder.\n   - Easy integration with Flask for file browsing and manipulation.\n   - It offers a simple UI that feels like a modern file explorer.\n\n3. **Flask-FileManager** (Simpler, Flask-specific solution)\n   - **Capabilities**: Provides basic file management operations like listing, uploading, and deleting files, but with a simpler UI compared to the Windows File Explorer.\n   - **Back-end Integration**: Direct integration with Flask using RESTful APIs for file management.\n\n   #### Flask-FileManager Setup:\n   \n   - Install the library: `pip install flask-filemanager`\n   \n   - Create a basic Flask app using the `Flask-FileManager` extension:\n\n     ```python\n     from flask import Flask\n     from flask_filemanager import FileManager\n\n     app = Flask(__name__)\n     file_manager = FileManager(app)\n\n     app.config['FILEMANAGER_FILE_PATH'] = '/path/to/your/files'  # Set file path\n\n     @app.route('/')\n     def index():\n         return file_manager.render_file_manager()\n\n     if __name__ == '__main__':\n         app.run(debug=True)\n     ```\n\n   - **Why Flask-FileManager?**\n     - It's purpose-built for Flask and provides a simplified file browser interface.\n     - It's perfect for users looking for a basic file manager without the complexity of a full UI like ElFinder or RichFileManager.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **For full Windows File Browser-like functionality**: Go with **ElFinder** for the most extensive capabilities and full control over file operations.\n- **For a simpler and more modern UI**: Use **RichFileManager** for a lightweight experience.\n- **For minimal setup and direct Flask support**: Consider **Flask-FileManager**, which is easy to integrate but lacks some of the advanced UI features of other tools.\n\nEach of these libraries can be set up with a Flask backend, allowing full control over the file system with a modern, browser-based interface that mimics desktop file explorers.",
