      "To deploy a Google Apps Script application that concatenates two Google Sheets and produces a new Google Sheet, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write the Google Apps Script code**:\n   - Open Google Sheets and navigate to \"Extensions\" > \"Apps Script\" to open the Google Apps Script editor.\n   - Write a script to concatenate the two sheets and create a new sheet with the combined data. Here's a basic example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction concatenateSheets() {\n  // Get the two sheets by their IDs or names\n  var sheet1 = SpreadsheetApp.openById(\"SHEET1_ID\").getSheetByName(\"Sheet1\");\n  var sheet2 = SpreadsheetApp.openById(\"SHEET2_ID\").getSheetByName(\"Sheet2\");\n\n  // Get the data range of each sheet\n  var data1 = sheet1.getDataRange().getValues();\n  var data2 = sheet2.getDataRange().getValues();\n\n  // Combine data from both sheets\n  var combinedData = data1.concat(data2);\n\n  // Create a new sheet to store the combined data\n  var newSheet = SpreadsheetApp.create(\"Combined Sheet\");\n\n  // Get the first sheet of the new spreadsheet\n  var newSheetContent = newSheet.getSheets()[0];\n\n  // Set the values of the new sheet to the combined data\n  newSheetContent.getRange(1, 1, combinedData.length, combinedData[0].length).setValues(combinedData);\n}\n```\n\n2. **Deploy the script as a web app**:\n   - In the Apps Script editor, go to \"Publish\" > \"Deploy as web app\".\n   - Choose a new version or update the existing one.\n   - Set the access rights. If you want it to be accessible by anyone, choose \"Anyone, even anonymous\".\n   - Click \"Deploy\".\n\n3. **Authorize the script**:\n   - You might need to authorize the script to access your Google Sheets. Follow the prompts to do so.\n\n4. **Obtain the web app URL**:\n   - After deploying, you'll get a URL for the web app. This is the URL you'll use to run the script.\n\n5. **Run the script**:\n   - Open the web app URL in your browser. This will execute the `concatenateSheets` function, which combines the data from the two sheets and creates a new sheet.\n\n6. **Access the combined data**:\n   - Once the script has run successfully, you can access the newly created Google Sheet from your Google Drive.\n\nRemember to replace \"SHEET1_ID\" and \"SHEET2_ID\" with the actual IDs of the two sheets you want to concatenate. Additionally, you may need to adjust the script to suit your specific needs, such as handling headers, formatting, etc."
