      "To grant access to invoke a Google Cloud Function only to principals with an email address in a particular domain, you can use Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles along with condition expressions. Here's a general approach:\n\n1. **Create a Custom IAM Role**: First, create a custom IAM role that grants permission to invoke the Cloud Function.\n\n2. **Add a Condition to the Role**: Add a condition to the IAM role that specifies the allowed domain for the principal's email address.\n\n3. **Assign the Role to the Principals**: Finally, assign the custom IAM role to the users or service accounts whose email addresses match the specified domain.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement this:\n\n1. **Create a Custom IAM Role**: You can create a custom role using the Google Cloud Console, gcloud command-line tool, or the IAM API. Below is an example using the gcloud command-line tool:\n\n```bash\ngcloud iam roles create custom.functionInvoker --project=your-project-id --title=\"Custom Function Invoker\" --description=\"Allows invocation of Cloud Functions\" --permissions=cloudfunctions.invoker\n```\n\n2. **Add a Condition to the Role**: You can add a condition to the role using the `--condition` flag with the `gcloud` command-line tool. For example, to restrict access to users with email addresses in the domain `example.com`, you can use the following condition:\n\n```bash\ngcloud iam roles add-iam-policy-binding custom.functionInvoker --member=user:example@example.com --condition=expression='request.auth.claims.email.endsWith(\"@example.com\")'\n```\n\n3. **Assign the Role to the Principals**: Once you have created the custom role and added the condition, you can assign this role to the users or service accounts whose email addresses match the specified domain using the `gcloud` command-line tool or the Cloud Console.\n\n```bash\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding your-project-id --member=user:example@example.com --role=projects/your-project-id/roles/custom.functionInvoker\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can do this via the Google Cloud Console by navigating to IAM & Admin > IAM, clicking \"Add\", and specifying the user's email address and the custom role you created.\n\nWith this setup, only users whose email addresses end with \"@example.com\" will have permission to invoke the specified Cloud Function. Adjust the domain and role names as needed for your specific use case."

      "I see, it seems there was another misunderstanding. Unfortunately, the `gcloud` command-line tool doesn't provide a direct way to add conditions to IAM roles. You can only update roles using `gcloud iam roles update` with predefined flags, and conditions aren't directly supported in that context.\n\nTo add conditions to an IAM role, you'll need to use the Google Cloud IAM API directly. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this using the API:\n\n1. **Get the Existing Role**: First, you need to get the current definition of the custom role using the `gcloud` command or directly from the IAM API.\n\n2. **Add Condition to the Role Definition**: Modify the role definition to include the condition you want to apply.
