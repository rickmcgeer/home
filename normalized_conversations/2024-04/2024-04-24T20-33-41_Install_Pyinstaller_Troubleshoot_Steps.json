      "It sounds like there might be an issue with the installation or configuration of PyInstaller. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem:\n\n1. **Check Installation**: First, confirm that PyInstaller was installed successfully. You can do this by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:\n\n    ```\n    pip show pyinstaller\n    ```\n\n    This command should display information about the installed PyInstaller package, including its version number.\n\n2. **Check Python Installation**: Ensure that Python is installed correctly and that its executable is in your system's PATH. You can check this by running:\n\n    ```\n    python --version\n    ```\n\n    This command should display the version of Python installed on your system.\n\n3. **Check PATH Environment Variable**: Sometimes, the Python Scripts directory (where PyInstaller might be installed) might not be in your system's PATH environment variable. You can check this by running:\n\n    ```\n    echo %PATH%\n    ```\n\n    Verify if the directory where Python and PyInstaller are installed is listed in the PATH.\n\n4. **Reinstall PyInstaller**: If PyInstaller was installed but still isn't working, you can try reinstalling it to see if that resolves the issue:\n\n    ```\n    pip uninstall pyinstaller\n    pip install pyinstaller\n    ```\n\n5. **Use Specific Python Version**: If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your system, ensure that you are using the correct version when installing and running PyInstaller. You can specify the Python version with the `-m` flag when installing packages:\n\n    ```\n    py -3.x -m pip install pyinstaller\n    ```\n\n    Replace `3.x` with the version of Python you want to use.\n\n6. **Check for Errors**: If none of the above steps work, try to observe if there are any error messages during installation or when attempting to use PyInstaller. These messages can provide valuable clues about what might be going wrong.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue with PyInstaller not being found on your system. If you encounter any specific error messages or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
