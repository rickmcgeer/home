      "GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It was developed and open-sourced by Facebook in 2015, and has since become a popular choice for building modern, scalable, and flexible APIs. GraphQL provides a declarative and flexible way for clients to request the data they need from an API, and for servers to expose their data in a way that can be easily consumed by clients. This allows for more efficient and flexible data fetching, as clients can request only the data they need, in the exact format they need it, without over-fetching or under-fetching data. Additionally, GraphQL provides built-in support for real-time data updates and subscriptions, allowing clients to receive updates in real-time when the data they are interested in changes."
