      "A data lake is a large, centralized repository of structured and unstructured data that is used for storing and processing big data. Data lakes are typically built on top of a distributed file system, such as Hadoop, and are designed to store and manage large volumes of data in a scalable and cost-effective manner. Data lakes can store a wide variety of data types, including structured data from transactional systems, unstructured data from sensors and social media feeds, and even raw data from scientific experiments and research. Because data lakes are designed to store and manage large amounts of data, they are often used for big data analytics and machine learning applications."
