      "To properly shut down and delete all pods in your **Zero to JupyterHub** setup, follow these steps:\n\n### **1. Scale Down the Hub & User Pods**\nSince JupyterHub automatically restarts pods when they are deleted, you need to scale the deployment down to zero first:\n\n```bash\nkubectl scale deployment hub --replicas=0 -n jupyterhub\nkubectl scale deployment proxy --replicas=0 -n jupyterhub\nkubectl scale statefulset user-scheduler --replicas=0 -n jupyterhub\nkubectl scale statefulset dask-gateway --replicas=0 -n jupyterhub  # If using Dask\n```\n\nThis prevents the Hub, proxy, and user-related services from respawning.\n\n### **2. Delete All User Pods**\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod --all -n jupyterhub\n```\n\n### **3. Delete the Helm Release**\nIf you want to remove JupyterHub entirely, delete the Helm release:\n\n```bash\nhelm delete jupyterhub -n jupyterhub\n```\n\nThen remove the namespace:\n\n```bash\nkubectl delete namespace jupyterhub\n```\n\n### **4. Verify Pods are Gone**\nCheck that no JupyterHub-related pods are running:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -A\n```\n\nIf you still see pods, you may need to manually delete orphaned ones.\n\n### **5. Stop Kubernetes (if running locally)**\nSince you're using **Docker on WSL2**, ensure Kubernetes is actually stopped:\n\n```bash\nwsl --shutdown\n```\n\nor disable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop settings.\n\nThis should shut everything down and prevent pods from respawning. Let me know if you run into any issues! 🚀"
