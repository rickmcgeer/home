      "To change other settings in JupyterLab when the language setting changes, you can use the **JupyterLab Language Server** and its extension system to dynamically adjust settings based on the selected language.\n\nHere’s how you can implement this:\n\n### 1. **Use JupyterLab's Localization System**\nJupyterLab supports internationalization (i18n), so you can customize your settings based on the selected language.\n\n- In the JupyterLab interface, when you change the language (e.g., between English and Japanese), JupyterLab's frontend automatically switches to the appropriate language based on the user preference.\n\n### 2. **Modify Settings Based on Language**\nYou can hook into the **`LanguageChange` event** and apply custom changes to your settings.\n\nHere’s a high-level approach to achieve this:\n\n#### a) Listen to the Language Change Event:\nYou can use the `@jupyterlab/coreutils` package, which allows you to hook into language changes. For example, you can add an event listener for language change to update your custom settings.\n\n```javascript\nimport { LanguageManager } from '@jupyterlab/coreutils';\nimport { ISettingRegistry } from '@jupyterlab/settingregistry';\n\nconst languageManager = new LanguageManager();\nconst settingRegistry = new ISettingRegistry();\n\nlanguageManager.languageChanged.connect((sender, args) => {\n    const currentLanguage = args.newValue;\n    if (currentLanguage === 'ja') {\n        // Apply your custom settings for Japanese\n        settingRegistry.set('your-extension', 'settingName', 'valueForJapanese');\n    } else {\n        // Apply your custom settings for English (or other languages)\n        settingRegistry.set('your-extension', 'settingName', 'valueForEnglish');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n#### b) Update Specific Settings:\nYou can update specific JupyterLab settings by accessing the **`SettingRegistry`**. For example, you can change the theme or layout when the language is switched.\n\n```javascript\nsettingRegistry.set('@jupyterlab/apputils-extension:themes', 'theme', 'light');\n```\n\n### 3. **Example Customization**\nIf you want to customize how certain elements or behavior (like tooltips, button labels, etc.) behave based on the language, you can also dynamically switch between different components or data.\n\nFor example:\n- Changing the `theme` setting if the language is set to Japanese.\n- Adjusting labels or tooltips in your custom JupyterLab extensions based on the selected language.\n\n### 4. **Create a Custom Extension** (Optional):\nIf you are developing a custom extension, you can also listen for language changes and update settings dynamically by using the extension’s own API.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`LanguageManager`** and **`SettingRegistry`** are central to managing changes based on language settings.\n- Use the **`languageChanged`** signal to trigger custom behavior when the language changes.\n\nWould you like more detailed steps on creating a custom extension for this or further assistance with a particular setting?"
