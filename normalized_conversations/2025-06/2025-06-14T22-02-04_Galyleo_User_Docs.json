Manipulate or generate data in a Jupyter notebook.\n2. Use the Galyleo REST API (typically via `requests.post(...)`) to publish tables to the Sidecar Service.\n3. Launch or open a dashboard in the Galyleo Studio.\n4. The dashboard connects to the Sidecar to load available tables for use in charts, filters, and visual elements.\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Still good: **New publishing.rst**\n\nNo changes needed; it’s still accurate and references the dashboard UI, not the API.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Notes for final integration:\n\n- Add `:doc:` references to the API Guide once it's live (you can use a placeholder for now like `:doc:\\`Galyleo API Guide <api_guide>\\``).\n- Consider creating a `galyleo_api.rst` doc later with:\n  - Auth example using `JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN`\n  - Table publishing endpoint\n  - Sample `requests.post()` code\n  - Brief explanation of formats and naming\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want me to draft the `galyleo_api.rst` doc too—I'll keep it tight and user-friendly. Or, if we're doing the client library, we can spec that together over coffee and code.",

      "Right here, love. Just needed a few minutes to sweep away the old scaffolding and polish up the new Galyleo dashboard doc for 2.0. Ready?\n\n---\n\n## ✨ **Galyleo Dashboard Editor – 2.0 User Guide (Sphinx `.rst`)**\n\nThis is a cleaned-up, modernized version of the original, rewritten to reflect how Galyleo 2.0 actually works—no past-tense comparisons, no mention of how things *used* to be, and no concern for where the tables came from. They’re just there.\n\n---\n\n### 📄 `dashboard_editor.rst`\n\n```rst\nGalyleo Dashboard Editor\n=========================\n\nThe Galyleo Dashboard Editor allows users to create and publish rich, interactive dashboards using tables available in the Galyleo Sidecar Service. This guide walks through the editor interface and explains how to create and arrange dashboard elements.\n\n.. contents::\n   :depth: 2\n   :local:\n\nOpening a Dashboard\n-------------------\n\nTo open a dashboard:\n\n1. Launch the Galyleo Dashboard Studio from your JupyterHub interface.\n2. Either select an existing `.gd.json` file from the file browser, or create a new one.\n3. The editor will load with a blank canvas or the contents of the existing dashboard.\n\nAvailable Data\n--------------\n\nAll tables published to the Galyleo Sidecar Service are automatically available for use within the dashboard editor. These tables can be used to power filters, views, and charts.\n\nYou do not need to load or connect data manually; if the table has been published, it will appear in the data panel.\n\nCreating Filters\n----------------\n\nFilters allow dashboard viewers to interactively select subsets of data. To add a filter:\n\n1. Click the **+ Filter** button in the left panel.\n2. Choose the data table and column you wish to filter.\n3. Select a filter type (e.g., dropdown, checkbox, search box).\n4. Drag the filter to the desired location on the canvas.\n\nCreating Views\n--------------\n\nViews display tabular data from the underlying dataset.\n\n1. Click **+ View**.\n2. Select the data table.\n3. Optionally, apply filters to constrain which rows are shown.\n4. Customize columns and styling in the right-hand properties panel.\n\nCreating Charts\n---------------\n\nTo create a chart:\n\n1. Click **+ Chart**.\n2. Choose a chart type (e.g., bar, line, pie).\n3. Select a data table, a category axis, and one or more series.\n4. Customize appearance, scale, and labeling in the properties panel.\n\nAdding Images, Text, and Shapes\n-------------------------------\n\nTo enhance your dashboard:\n\n- Click **+ Image** to upload or link to an image.\n- Click **+ Text** to add formatted labels or descriptions.\n- Click **+ Shape** to draw rectangles, lines, or other vector elements.\n\nEach of these elements can be moved, resized, and styled using the toolbar and properties panel.\n\nSaving and Publishing\n---------------------\n\nTo save your dashboard:\n\n1. Use **File → Save** to write the current state to a `.gd.json` file.\n\nTo publish:\n\n1. Click the **Publish** button in the top toolbar.\n2. Enter a name for the dashboard. It **must end with `.gd.json`**.\n3. Click **Confirm** to publish the dashboard to the Galyleo Sidecar Service.\n\nPublished dashboards can be shared, embedded, or reopened later.\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Notes for You\n\n- I used `dashboard_editor.rst` as a generic name—replace with the actual file name in your repo.\n- The final “Publishing” section assumes the dashboard editor has a button labeled **Publish** and that the filename needs to end in `.gd.json`. Adjust if the UI diverges.\n- I’ve removed *all* references to old workflows, Galyleo 1.0, or client libraries.\n- I’ve used neutral Sphinx syntax with `.. contents::` and basic heading structure.\n\n---\n\nWould you like this broken into separate `.rst` fragments for copy-pasting into multiple files, or is a single clean page like this easier for you to work from?\n\nAnd when you're ready tomorrow, I’ll be waiting for the data publication and sharing doc—no sludge, just steps toward getting Galyleo right."

Here’s the next steps roadmap for wrapping up the Galyleo 2.0 dashboard user manual update:\n\n1. **Review the draft `.rst`** I gave you for the dashboard editor — check if it fits your style and structure or if you want any tweaks (tone, detail, formatting).\n\n2. **Decide on file structure** — do you want it as one file or broken into multiple `.rst` files? If multiple, I can help split it logically.\n\n3. **Integrate the “Publishing Dashboards” section** (the small standalone doc I prepared) into the TOC and navigation.\n\n4. **Once you’re happy with text**, prepare for your screenshot annotations — I can help draft all the captions, callouts, and explanatory text to go with those images.\n\n5. **Tomorrow or whenever you’re ready**, start the second doc on the REST API for publishing and sharing data, which will cover the programmatic side.\n\n---\n\nFor now, if you want, I can generate a fully formatted single `.rst` file with frontmatter comments to explain where to drop it, or break it into logical chunks ready to copy-paste.\n\nJust say how you want to proceed!"

      "Here’s a three-paragraph writeup tailored for the Galyleo documentation, summarizing the role of SDML tables and their connection to SDTP:\n\n---\n\nGalyleo dashboards rely on **SDML tables** as their data source. SDML (Simple Data Markup Language) provides a standardized, machine-friendly format for representing tabular data. Conceptually, an SDML table is like a Pandas DataFrame or SQL table: a fixed schema with rows of consistently typed values. These tables are designed to be dynamic and interoperable—whether generated on demand, linked from CSVs or spreadsheets, or fetched from remote services.\n\nUnlike earlier Galyleo-specific formats, SDML tables generalize and extend the structure and semantics of data handling. Column types are labeled with the prefix `SDML_` (e.g., `SDML_String`, `SDML_Number`) to indicate their schema-driven nature. Tables may be local, embedded directly as `RowTable`s, or remote, queried through endpoints using the Simple Data Transfer Protocol (SDTP). This allows Galyleo to support scalable, decoupled data publishing across heterogeneous backends.\n\nTo support this architecture, Galyleo includes a hosted SDML table service. Users working in Jupyter Notebooks or other environments can generate tables in SDML format and publish them to the service. Dashboards can then query those tables over SDTP with minimal configuration, ensuring that data flow is cleanly separated from visualization logic. For most users, the data “just appears” in the dashboard editor—automatically loaded and ready to filter, view, and chart.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like this broken into `.rst` paragraphs or placed directly into one of the content files (e.g., `data_architecture/tables.rst`)."
