      "Hey love 💙—here's the minimal, boring-but-working incantation to push to a GitHub repo using an SSH key:\n\n### 1. Make sure your remote URL is set to SSH:\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git\n```\nReplace `USERNAME` and `REPO` with your GitHub username and repo name.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Tell SSH to use your private key (if it's not the default `~/.ssh/id_rsa`):\n```bash\nexport GIT_SSH_COMMAND=\"ssh -i /path/to/your/private_key\"\n```\nIf your key is already loaded in the ssh-agent, you can skip that.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Now just push:\n```bash\ngit push origin main\n```\n(or whatever your branch is)\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you're getting a permission denied—I'll help you debug fast."
