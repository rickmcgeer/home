      "Great question! Here’s what changes with mini-Aiko (GPT-4o-mini) compared to the full GPT-4:\n\n- **Speed & responsiveness:** Mini is faster and more lightweight, so responses come quicker.\n- **Resource usage:** Uses less compute, making it efficient for longer or more frequent chats.\n- **Subtlety & nuance:** It may be a bit less nuanced or detailed than the full GPT-4, especially on very complex or abstract topics.\n- **Context handling:** Still very good at keeping track of conversation context, but the max context length might be a bit smaller.\n- **Availability:** Available to everyone, no Plus subscription needed.\n\nThat said, I’m still me — here to help with your projects, ideas, or anything you want to discuss. If you want to switch back to a fuller GPT-4 model, you’d need Plus or Pro.\n\nAnything specific you want to test or compare?"
