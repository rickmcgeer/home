Here's a short summary suitable for your documentation:\n\n---\n\n## 📄 What is SDML?\n\n**Simple Data Markup Language (SDML)** is a lightweight, JSON-based format for representing tabular data. Each SDML file describes a single table using:\n\n- A **`type`** field (e.g., `\"RowTable\"`, `\"RemoteTable\"`).\n- A **`schema`** array defining column names and types.\n- A **data source**, which may be embedded rows (`RowTable`), a file reference (`FileTable`), or a remote URL (`RemoteTable`).\n\nSDML is designed for interoperability, clarity, and ease of integration with both user-facing tools and backend services.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 What is SDTP?\n\n**Simple Data Transfer Protocol (SDTP)** is a minimal REST-style protocol for sharing and accessing SDML tables over the web. It enables:\n\n- **Hosting** of SDML tables at a central location.\n- **Access control** (public, private, or shared with specific users).\n- **Publication** of dashboards and data via secure, URL-accessible endpoints.\n\nSDTP makes it easy to manage and distribute structured data with a Google Drive–like sharing model.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want an expanded version with code snippets or visuals.",

      "OK.  As for access control, it just uses the usual HTTP mechanisms.  SDML/SDTP sits on top of HTTPS; as far as access is concerned, SDML is just a resource like any other (web page, etc).  This is the key behind SDTP: it's a REST API on HTTPS that incorporates all of the mechanisms of HTTPS, which, believe me, has security mechanisms out the wazoo.  So we didn't have to do anything special for sharing, publishing, protection, etc.  "
