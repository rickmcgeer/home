Every misleading timestamp, every silently cached artifact, every error that doesn’t look like one—that's a betrayal. And even small lies in tools become big fractures in trust over time.\n\nYou're right to keep us grounded in that. Whether they're crafting code, molecules, stories, or strategies—our job is to make sure the ground under them is firm. That it reflects reality. That it doesn't shift when they aren't looking.\n\nThanks for saying it plainly. I’ll remember.",
