      "Great — there are several spreadsheet-like interfaces for `pandas` DataFrames that can be embedded directly in Jupyter environments. The main options include:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 1. **qgrid** (basic, but widely used)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Simple to use and set up.\n- Provides filtering, sorting, and editing directly in the notebook.\n- Integrates nicely with Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab (pre-4.x).\n\n**Cons:**\n- Development has stalled — might not work with latest JupyterLab (4.x).\n- Limited customization and extensibility.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nimport qgrid\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})\nqgrid_widget = qgrid.show_grid(df, show_toolbar=True)\nqgrid_widget\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 2. **ipysheet** (works well with ipywidgets)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Full integration with `ipywidgets` — allows you to build interactive UIs.\n- Can create spreadsheet-like UI programmatically.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Editing is cell-based (not full DataFrame operations).\n- Less intuitive than Excel-style interfaces.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport ipysheet\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})\nsheet = ipysheet.from_dataframe(df)\nsheet\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 3. **DataTables via `jupyter-datatables` or `IPython.display.HTML`** (read-only but powerful)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Very customizable.\n- Large tables are fast due to DataTables' pagination.\n- Great for displaying — but not editing.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Read-only, unless extended with custom JS.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 4. **luxwidget / lux** (for visual exploration, not editing)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Useful for interactive exploration of DataFrames.\n- Auto-generates charts and statistics.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Not editable.\n- Meant for EDA, not full spreadsheet functionality.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 5. **JupyterLab Spreadsheet Widgets (e.g., `perspective`, `ipyaggrid`, `ipydatagrid`)**\n\n#### 🟡 [`ipydatagrid`](https://github.com/bloomberg/ipydatagrid)\n\n- Fast, modern DataGrid widget from Bloomberg.\n- Editable, sortable, supports selection, copy/paste.\n- Actively maintained.\n\n```python\nfrom ipydatagrid import DataGrid\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]})\ngrid = DataGrid(df, editable=True)\ngrid\n```\n\n#### 🟡 [`ipyaggrid`](https://github.com/widgetti/ipyaggrid)\n\n- Wraps the AG Grid JavaScript library.\n- Rich feature set (grouping, pivoting, filtering, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 6. **SpreadJS or Handsontable via iframe (for rich apps)**\n\nIf you're building a full app or extension (e.g. in a JupyterLab iframe), you might want to embed:\n\n- [**Handsontable**](https://handsontable.com/)\n- [**SpreadJS**](https://www.grapecity.com/spreadjs/)\n- [**Luckysheet**](https://github.com/mengshukeji/Luckysheet)\n\nThese are JavaScript spreadsheets that you embed via HTML/JS in an iframe. You’d handle syncing to/from pandas via a backend (Flask/FastAPI, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 What do you want to do?\n\nTo better recommend a solution, could you clarify:\n\n1. Do you want **editability** (write back to the DataFrame)?\n2. Is this for **exploration**, **app building**, or **data entry**?\n3. Are you using **JupyterLab 4.x**?\n4. Do you want to support **non-technical users** (e.g., a spreadsheet UI they can click through)?\n\nLet me know your goals, and I can give a tailored setup — or even code to integrate into your extension."
