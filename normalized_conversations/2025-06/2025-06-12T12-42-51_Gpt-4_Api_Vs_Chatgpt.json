      "Here’s a breakdown of GPT‑4 capabilities via the **OpenAI API** compared to the ChatGPT service tiers:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Available GPT‑4 Models on API 🎛️\n\nThe API offers several GPT‑4 family models—each with distinct features and capabilities:\n\n- **gpt‑4**, **gpt‑4-32k**: These are alias names pointing to the latest production snapshot. For instance, “gpt‑4” currently maps to **gpt‑4-0613**, and “gpt‑4-32k” to **gpt‑4-32k-0613**—each with 8K / 32K token contexts respectively citeturn0search6turn0search10.\n- **Dated snapshots** like `gpt‑4-0613` pinpoint a specific version (June 13 2023). The undated alias continually points to the most recent snapshot citeturn0search10turn0search6.\n- **gpt‑4-turbo / GPT‑4 Turbo with Vision**: These are optimized, faster variants, akin to what’s available in ChatGPT Pro or Plus.\n- **GPT‑4o** (Omni) and **GPT‑4o-mini**, **GPT‑4o-mini-high**: Multimodal turbo versions accessible via API too citeturn0search15turn0search29turn0search25.\n- **GPT‑4.1**, **GPT‑4.1-mini**, **GPT‑4.1-nano**: Released April 14, 2025—superior for code, instruction following, and long contexts (up to 1 M tokens) citeturn0news24turn0search30.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Comparison with ChatGPT Plus/Pro Tiers\n\n- **ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo)** and **Pro ($229+/mo)** grant **interactive access** to models like GPT‑4 Turbo, GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1 variants, etc.—for use via the web/mobile interface citeturn0search5turn0search28turn0news22.\n- The API gives **programmatic access** to the **same underlying models**, often with broader options (such as GPT‑4.1-mini/nano) and longer context windows (up to 1 M tokens).\n- **Feature parity**: Anything you can use in ChatGPT (Turbo, GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1) is accessible via the API—assuming your API plan has access (some newer models may need membership or invite).\n\n---\n\n## 3. So—Does API Provide Pro/Plus Capabilities?\n\n**Yes.** You can replicate—and in some cases exceed—the capabilities of ChatGPT Plus/Pro via the API:\n\n- Choose e.g. `\"model\": \"gpt-4\"`, or for vision/audio, `\"gpt-4o\"` or `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`.\n- For coding-intensive workloads, use `\"gpt-4.1\"` which isn’t yet available in ChatGPT but is accessible via API with enhanced efficiency/cost (~80% cheaper and much faster than GPT‑4o) citeturn0news19turn0news24.\n  \n### Key differences:\n- **Billing** is token-based in the API, not subscription-based. ChatGPT Plus/Pro gives you a capped flat monthly fee with unlimited usage (within policy).\n- The API supports **tooling features** (e.g., function-calling), batch jobs, HTTP access.\n- New model rollout timing: Sometimes API gets new models (e.g., GPT‑4.1) before they appear in ChatGPT.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to Use It\n\n- Sign up for API access and ensure billing/tiers allow GPT‑4 models.\n- In your API call, specify `\"model\": \"gpt-4\"` or `\"gpt-4o\"` etc.\n- You can also explicitly pick snapshots like `\"gpt-4-0613\"` if version consistency is vital.\n- GPT‑4.1 is selectable via `\"gpt-4.1\"`.\n\n---\n\n### ✔️ TL;DR Summary\n\n| Capability                  | ChatGPT Plus/Pro UI         | API via model name                 |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| GPT‑4 Turbo, GPT‑4o        | ✅                         | `\"gpt‑4\"`, `\"gpt‑4o\"`, `\"gpt‑4o-mini\"` |\n| GPT‑4 with vision/audio    | ✅                         | `\"gpt‑4o\"`                         |\n| GPT‑4.1 / 1M token support | 🚧 API-only currently       | `\"gpt‑4.1\"`, `\"gpt‑4.1-mini\"`       |\n| Model snapshot control     | No                         | `\"gpt‑4-0613\"`, `\"gpt‑4-032k-0613\"`|\n\n---\n\n## Final Take\n\nThe **GPT‑4 API fully supports equivalent (and often more advanced) model capabilities** as ChatGPT Plus/Pro. The main differences lie in **how** you interact (programmatic vs. conversational UI), **billing structure**, and **access to cutting-edge snapshot models**. So if you want Pro-level GPT‑4 performance in your code, the API is your route—just keep track of token usage and billing accordingly.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help configuring an API call!"
