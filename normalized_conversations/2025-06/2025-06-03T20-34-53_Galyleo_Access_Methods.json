      "Sure, here’s an expanded version with a paragraph on each method of obtaining access:\n\n---\n\n**Access via JupyterHub Login**  \nUsers gain access to the Galyleo Service through single sign-on using their JupyterHub credentials. When a user logs into the parent JupyterHub instance, they are automatically authenticated for the Galyleo Service without needing to re-enter credentials. This seamless login experience is managed through the integration of JupyterHub’s authentication system with the Galyleo Service, ensuring that all user sessions are securely tied to their JupyterHub identity. This method is ideal for interactive use within the Jupyter ecosystem and ensures consistent user identity across services.\n\n**Access via API Tokens**  \nFor programmatic access, such as from scripts or notebooks, the Galyleo Service supports authentication via API tokens. These tokens can be generated through the Admin menu of the JupyterHub interface, where users with appropriate privileges can create and manage tokens for themselves or others. Once generated, tokens are securely made available in the environment of Galyleo Servers via the `GALYLEO_API_TOKEN` environment variable. This allows notebooks and other automated clients to authenticate and interact with the Galyleo API without manual credential entry, enabling robust, secure access for automation and integration purposes."
