      "To list instances in Google Compute Engine using the Node.js client library, you can use the `compute.instances.list` method. Here's a basic example:\n\nFirst, make sure you have the `google-cloud` npm package installed:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @google-cloud/compute\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following Node.js code to list instances:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Compute } = require('@google-cloud/compute');\nconst compute = new Compute();\n\nasync function listInstances() {\n  const projectId = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'; // Replace with your project ID\n\n  // Get the default zone for the specified project\n  const [zones] = await compute.getZones({ projectId });\n  const zone = zones[0].name;\n\n  // List the instances in the specified project and zone\n  const [instances] = await compute.getVMs({ projectId, zone });\n\n  console.log('Instances:');\n  instances.forEach(instance => {\n    console.log(`- ${instance.name}`);\n  });\n}\n\nlistInstances();\n```\n\nReplace `'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual Google Cloud project ID. This code retrieves the default zone for the specified project and then lists the instances in that project and zone.\n\nMake sure your Google Cloud credentials are set up properly. You can either set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file or use `compute.auth` to authenticate programmatically.\n\n```javascript\n// Authenticate programmatically (if not using GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS)\nawait compute.auth.getClient();\n```\n\nRemember to handle errors and edge cases appropriately in a production environment."

      "If you switched to a new branch in Git and your changes were automatically stashed, you can recover them using the following steps:\n\n1. **List Stashes:**\n   \n   To see a list of your stashes, you can use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git stash list\n   ```\n\n   This will display a list of stashes along with a unique identifier (stash@{n}).\n\n2. **Apply Stash:**\n\n   If you want to apply the changes from the latest stash, you can use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git stash apply\n   ```\n\n   If you have multiple stashes and want to apply a specific one, you can specify the stash using its identifier:\n\n   ```bash\n   git stash apply stash@{n}\n   ```\n\n3. **Discard Stash:**\n\n   After applying the stash, Git keeps the stash in the list. If you want to remove it from the stash list, you can use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git stash drop\n   ```\n\n   If you applied a specific stash, you can drop it by specifying its identifier:\n\n   ```bash\n   git stash drop stash@{n}\n   ```\n\n   If you want to apply and drop in one command, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   git stash pop\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   git stash pop stash@{n}\n   ```\n\nRemember that applying a stash may result in conflicts if changes in the stash conflict with changes in your working directory or the branch you switched to.
