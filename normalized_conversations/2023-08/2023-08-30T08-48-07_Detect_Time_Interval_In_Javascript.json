Subtracting `startTime` from `endTime` will give you the time interval in milliseconds. You can then use the `console.log()` function to output the result.\n\nKeep in mind that this method measures the time it takes for the code to execute between the `startTime` and `endTime`. If you want to measure the time between two points in your code, make sure you place the `startTime` and `endTime` recording code appropriately."

      "Certainly! If you have a JSON object in Python and you want to print it as a JavaScript object with rounded floats to three decimal places, you can achieve this using the `json` module for parsing the JSON and formatting the output.

The `indent` argument controls the indentation of the output for better readability, and the `separators` argument adjusts the separators used between keys and values.\n\nRemember that JSON and JavaScript objects have similar syntax, but they are not the same thing. The code above is creating a string representation of a JSON object with rounded float values, suitable for use within a JavaScript context."
