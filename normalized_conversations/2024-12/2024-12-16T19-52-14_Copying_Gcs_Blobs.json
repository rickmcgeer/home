      "To create a table in BigQuery that uses the **folder name as a partition** in the Google Cloud Console, you can achieve this by creating a table with **partitioning based on ingestion time** or **partitioning based on a custom field** that stores the folder name.\n\nHere’s how you can do it:\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: Use a Custom Field for Partitioning by Folder Name**\nThis approach assumes that you have the folder name in your source data or can extract it during data ingestion. You will create a table partitioned by a custom column, such as `folder_name`.\n\n#### **Steps:**\n1. **Go to the BigQuery Console**:\n   - Open [BigQuery in Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).\n\n2. **Create a Dataset** (if not already created):\n   - On the left panel, click on your project name.\n   - Click **\"Create Dataset\"** and configure the dataset.\n\n3. **Create a Table**:\n   - Inside the dataset, click **\"Create Table\"**.\n\n4. **Select Source**:\n   - Under **Source**, select where your data resides (e.g., GCS bucket, file upload, or BigQuery storage).\n   - Choose the appropriate file format (CSV, JSON, etc.).\n\n5. **Schema**:\n   - Define your table schema, ensuring there’s a column for the folder name (e.g., `folder_name STRING`).\n\n6. **Partitioning Options**:\n   - Under the **\"Partition and cluster settings\"** section:\n     - Set **Partitioning type** to **Column**.\n     - In the **Partitioning column**, enter `folder_name`.\n\n7. **Load the Data**:\n   - During data ingestion, ensure the folder name is populated in the `folder_name` column.\n   - If you're loading data from GCS, you can pre-process the data to include the folder name as a field.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Use Ingestion Time Partitioning**\nIf the folder name is not available in the data itself but corresponds to the ingestion time, you can use time-based partitioning.\n\n#### **Steps:**\n1. **Follow Steps 1–4 Above**.\n\n2. **Schema**:\n   - Define your schema. A `TIMESTAMP` or `DATE` column (e.g., `ingestion_date`) is required for ingestion-time partitioning.\n\n3. **Partitioning Options**:\n   - Under **\"Partition and cluster settings\"**:\n     - Set **Partitioning type** to **Ingestion time**.\n\n4. **Mapping Folder Name to Partition Later**:\n   - During query time, you can use SQL to extract the folder name from the file path and use it for logical grouping.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 3: Using External Tables**\nIf you’re querying directly from GCS without loading data into BigQuery, you can use external tables and extract folder names from file paths.\n\n1. **Create an External Table**:\n   - Go to your dataset and click **\"Create Table\"**.\n   - Under **Source**, choose **Google Cloud Storage** and provide the URI pattern (e.g., `gs://bucket-name/folder-name/*`).\n\n2. **Extract Folder Name**:\n   - Use a SQL query with `REGEXP_EXTRACT` to extract the folder name from the file path.\n\n   Example SQL:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT\n     REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'gs://[^/]+/([^/]+)/') AS folder_name,\n     *\n   FROM\n     `project_id.dataset_id.external_table`\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Best Practices:\n- If folder name is a critical partition key, include it explicitly in your data schema.\n- Pre-process your data (e.g., using Dataflow or Cloud Functions) to add folder names as a field during ingestion.\n- Use clustering (e.g., by folder name) for optimized query performance in addition to partitioning."

This is typical if you've included them as columns in your files.\n     - **Option 2**: Extract these fields from the file path during ingestion (see below).\n\n---\n\n### **Extracting `year_month` and `CellName` from the File Path**\n\nIf your files do not contain the `year_month` and `CellName` values as columns, you can extract them from the file path using SQL during query time or preprocess the data before loading. Here’s how:\n\n#### **Using Preprocessing Tools (e.g., Dataflow or Python)**\nWrite a script or pipeline that:\n1. Reads each file from the bucket.\n2. Extracts the `year_month` and `CellName` values from the file path.\n3. Adds them as columns to your data.\n\n#### **SQL Extraction After Loading (External Tables or Native Tables)**\nIf you create an **external table** or load data without preprocessing, you can use `_FILE_NAME` to extract the values.\n\nExample SQL Query:\n```sql\nSELECT\n  REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'year_month=(\\d{6})') AS year_month,\n  REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'CellName=([^/]+)') AS CellName,\n  *\nFROM\n  `project_id.dataset_id.table_name`\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- Configure **partitioning** by `year_month` in the **Partition and Cluster Settings**.\n- Use **clustering** for additional optimization on `CellName`.\n- Ensure `year_month` and `CellName` are available as columns either:\n  - In your source data.\n  - Through preprocessing pipelines.\n  - Or by extracting them during query time using `_FILE_NAME`."

This is typical if you've included them as columns in your files.\n     - **Option 2**: Extract these fields from the file path during ingestion (see below).\n\n---\n\n### **Extracting `year_month` and `CellName` from the File Path**\n\nIf your files do not contain the `year_month` and `CellName` values as columns, you can extract them from the file path using SQL during query time or preprocess the data before loading. Here’s how:\n\n#### **Using Preprocessing Tools (e.g., Dataflow or Python)**\nWrite a script or pipeline that:\n1. Reads each file from the bucket.\n2. Extracts the `year_month` and `CellName` values from the file path.\n3. Adds them as columns to your data.\n\n#### **SQL Extraction After Loading (External Tables or Native Tables)**\nIf you create an **external table** or load data without preprocessing, you can use `_FILE_NAME` to extract the values.\n\nExample SQL Query:\n```sql\nSELECT\n  REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'year_month=(\\d{6})') AS year_month,\n  REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'CellName=([^/]+)') AS CellName,\n  *\nFROM\n  `project_id.dataset_id.table_name`\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- Configure **partitioning** by `year_month` in the **Partition and Cluster Settings**.\n- Use **clustering** for additional optimization on `CellName`.\n- Ensure `year_month` and `CellName` are available as columns either:\n  - In your source data.\n  - Through preprocessing pipelines.\n  - Or by extracting them during query time using `_FILE_NAME`.",

To resolve this and successfully load the data into BigQuery, you need to restructure your data loading approach while adhering to GCS's wildcard constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution: Load Data in Steps**\nHere’s how you can work around the limitation:\n\n#### **Step 1: Use a Single Wildcard in the GCS URI**\nSince GCS supports only one `*` wildcard in the URI, you can replace the multiple wildcards with a single wildcard for the parent folder.\n\nFor example:\n```plaintext\ngs://battery-data/cycle-stable/year_month=*/CellName=*\n```\nThis matches all files inside `cycle-stable` and its subdirectories, but it doesn’t distinguish `year_month` or `CellName` during the load.\n\n#### **Step 2: Add `year_month` and `CellName` as Metadata Columns**\nTo partition the data by `year_month` and `CellName`, extract these fields during the load process by:\n1. **Loading All Files with a Single Wildcard**.\n2. Using the `_FILE_NAME` pseudocolumn in BigQuery to extract the `year_month` and `CellName` values from the file path.\n\n#### **Step 3: Define a Query to Extract Partitions**\nAfter loading, you can write a SQL query to extract `year_month` and `CellName` from the file paths using regular expressions.\n\nExample:\n```sql\nSELECT\n  REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'year_month=(\\d{6})') AS year_month,\n  REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'CellName=([^/]+)') AS CellName,\n  *\nFROM\n  `project_id.dataset_id.table_name`\n```\n\nYou can then save this result as a new partitioned table in BigQuery.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative: Load Data Incrementally**\nIf you have many subdirectories and wish to avoid using `_FILE_NAME`, you can load the data incrementally:\n1. For each `year_month` folder, load the data with a GCS URI like:\n   ```plaintext\n   gs://battery-data/cycle-stable/year_month=202401/CellName=*/\n   ```\n2. Specify the `year_month` value manually during ingestion.\n\n3. Repeat this process for all `year_month` folders or automate it using a script.\n\n---\n\n### **Automating with a Script**\nIf you want to load all data programmatically, you can write a Python script using the `google-cloud-storage` and `google-cloud-bigquery` libraries to:\n1. List all files in the bucket.\n2. Parse their `year_month` and `CellName` values.\n3.

It relies entirely on the folder structure to infer partitions.\n\n3. **Flat Hierarchies Won’t Work**:\n   - All files must follow the same nested hierarchy (`year_month/.../CellName/...`) for partitioning to work properly.\n\n4. **Common Issues**:\n   - If you see errors like \"Does not contain path to table as a prefix,\" it often means:\n     - The URI prefix provided is incorrect.\n     - The files in GCS do not follow the same directory structure.\n\n---\n\n### **If This Still Doesn't Work**\nIf the console doesn't detect partitions correctly:\n- Verify your GCS folder structure matches exactly.\n- Double-check for typos or inconsistencies in the path (`year_month=` and `CellName=` must be consistent).\n- If necessary, you can create the table via a **bq command-line tool** or **API** for finer control over partitioning.\n\nLet me know if you encounter further issues!",
