      "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors typically occur when a web page served from one domain tries to make requests to a different domain using JavaScript, and the server at the other domain doesn't allow those requests due to security restrictions. Since you're encountering CORS errors when requests are made from pages originally served from a WordPress (WP) site, you can follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check CORS Configuration on Your Server**:\n   - Ensure that your server is correctly configured to handle CORS requests. This may involve adding specific headers to your server responses to allow cross-origin requests.\n\n2. **Review Your WordPress Site's Settings**:\n   - Check if your WordPress site has any CORS-related settings or plugins. Some security or caching plugins can interfere with CORS. Temporarily disabling such plugins can help identify the problem.\n\n3. **Inspect the CORS Error Message**:\n   - In your browser's developer tools console, you should see the exact CORS error message. This will help you identify the specific domain or origin that's causing the problem. The error message will typically specify which origin is being blocked.\n\n4. **Verify the Origin of Requests**:\n   - Ensure that the requests generated from the WordPress pages are correctly specifying the origin (e.g., with the `Origin` HTTP header) when making requests to your site. CORS errors can occur if the origin is not set correctly.\n\n5. **Check for Any JavaScript Errors**:\n   - Ensure there are no JavaScript errors on the WordPress pages that might prevent the CORS requests from being made.\n\n6. **Debugging in Postman or cURL**:\n   - Since you can make requests using Postman and cURL without errors, compare the headers you set in Postman/cURL with the headers sent from the WordPress site. Ensure that they match, including headers related to CORS like `Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.\n\n7. **Server Logs and Error Handling**:\n   - While you mentioned there are no logs on the server, make sure that your server is configured to log all requests, including those that generate CORS errors. This can provide valuable information about the incoming requests.\n\n8. **Check for Redirects or Rewrites**:\n   - Ensure that there are no server-side redirects or URL rewrites that might be altering the request headers in a way that causes CORS errors.\n\n9. **Browser Extensions and Ad-Blockers**:\n   - Some browser extensions or ad-blockers can interfere with CORS requests. Try accessing the WordPress site with all browser extensions disabled to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n10. **Testing with Different Browsers**:\n    - Test the WordPress site in different browsers to see if the issue is browser-specific.\n\n11. **Consult Documentation and Community Forums**:\n    - Check if there are any specific issues or solutions related to CORS and your server or WordPress version. WordPress forums and documentation can be helpful for this.\n\n12. **Engage a Developer or Expert**:\n    - If the issue persists and you are unable to resolve it, consider consulting a web developer or an expert in server and web application configurations. They can help diagnose and fix the problem.\n\nRemember that solving CORS issues can be complex and may involve adjustments both on the client (WordPress site) and the server. It's important to understand the specific cause of the CORS error before attempting to fix it."
