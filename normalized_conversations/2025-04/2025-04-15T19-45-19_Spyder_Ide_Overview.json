Designed for analysts, scientists, and business users, Galyleo streamlines the creation of applications that visualize and interact with live data, enabling faster decision-making and clearer data storytelling. Users can design responsive layouts using a visual editor, bind UI components to live data sources such as BigQuery, Snowflake, and REST APIs, and configure user interactions through a declarative interface.\n\nGalyleo apps support real-time interactivity, filters, and parameterized queries, making it easy to explore scenarios, monitor KPIs, or guide workflows. While the platform is accessible to non-developers, it also provides flexibility for developers to extend apps using JavaScript, SQL, and custom components when needed. Applications can be deployed as standalone web apps, shared with teams, or embedded within other platforms—such as JupyterLab—allowing seamless integration into existing workflows.\n\nBy removing the need to build full front-end stacks, Galyleo significantly reduces development time and effort. It is particularly well-suited for internal tools, executive dashboards, analytics portals, and customer-facing data apps. With Galyleo, turning raw data into engaging, interactive applications becomes fast, scalable, and approachable."

Inspired by OpenAI’s API format, LiteLLM simplifies switching between providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral, Groq, and more. It offers a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI SDK, allowing users to run the same code against various models without changing the logic. LiteLLM supports logging, usage tracking, caching, rate limiting, and team-based access controls, making it valuable for developers, platform teams, and organizations managing multiple LLM endpoints. It’s fast, extensible, and designed to integrate easily into production pipelines."
