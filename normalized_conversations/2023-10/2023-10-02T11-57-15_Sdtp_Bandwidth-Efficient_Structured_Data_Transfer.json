      "The Simple Data Transfer Protocol (SDTP) is a versatile and efficient method for transferring structured data, specifically tables, across the Internet. One of its key functionalities is at-source filtering, which plays a crucial role in conserving bandwidth during data transmission. At-source filtering enables data senders to intelligently select and transmit only the data that is necessary, relevant, or requested by the recipient, rather than sending entire tables or datasets. This selective transmission of data minimizes the amount of information transferred over the network, optimizing bandwidth utilization and reducing the burden on both the sender and the receiver.\n\nBy incorporating at-source filtering, SDTP offers several advantages. First, it significantly reduces the volume of data transferred, which is especially important when dealing with large datasets or limited bandwidth connections. This can lead to faster data transfers and more efficient network usage. Second, it allows for more granular control over data transmission, ensuring that only essential data is sent, enhancing security, and reducing the risk of data breaches. Overall, SDTP's at-source filtering functionality makes it a valuable tool for efficiently and securely transferring structured data across the Internet while minimizing the impact on network resources."

By using HTTP/HTTPS, SDTP benefits from the established security mechanisms, portability, and reliability of these protocols. HTTPS, in particular, ensures data encryption and secure communication, which is crucial when transmitting structured data, such as tables, over the Internet.\n\nIn terms of its wire format, SDTP adopts JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as the data serialization format. JSON is a lightweight, human-readable, and widely supported format that is ideal for representing structured data. This choice allows SDTP to easily encode complex tables and datasets into JSON objects, making it accessible and easy to work with for both humans and machines. JSON's simplicity and compatibility with various programming languages and platforms ensure that SDTP can be used across a wide range of applications, from web development to mobile apps and beyond.

      "The Simple Data Transfer Protocol (SDTP) defines a set of data types for encoding structured data in its wire format, which is JSON. These data types include:\n\n1. **String:** This type represents text or character data. Strings are commonly used to store alphanumeric information such as names, descriptions, and textual content.\n\n2. **Number:** Number data type is used to represent numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. It is suitable for storing quantitative data like quantities, measurements, or any numerical values.\n\n3. **Boolean:** Boolean data type has two possible values, true or false, and is used to represent binary or logical states. It's often used for conditions, flags, or binary decisions.\n\n4. **Date:** The date data type is used to represent dates without a specific time component. Dates are typically formatted in the ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for consistency and easy parsing.\n\n5. **Datetime:** Datetime represents both a date and a time, down to the second precision. In SDTP, datetime values are typically formatted in ISO 8601 datetime format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).\n\n6. **Timestamp:** A timestamp represents a date and time, including milliseconds or microseconds for precise time tracking. SDTP uses the ISO 8601 timestamp format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ssssss) for encoding timestamp values.\n\nThese data types provide a comprehensive way to represent and transmit structured data with different formats and precision. Using ISO 8601 formats for date, datetime, and timestamp ensures consistency and ease of parsing when exchanging data with SDTP across various platforms and applications."

Here's the structure and usage of this operator:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"operator\": \"ALL\",\n   \"arguments\": [<list of filters>]\n}\n```\n\n- `\"operator\"`: Set to `\"ALL\"` to specify the use of the \"ALL\" operator.\n- `\"arguments\"`: Replace `<list of filters>` with an array of filter conditions. Each filter condition in the list must evaluate to true for a row to pass through the filter.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose you want to filter rows in a dataset based on multiple criteria. You have three filter conditions: one for filtering by \"Category,\" another for filtering by \"Price,\" and a third for filtering by \"Rating.\" You can use the `\"ALL\"` operator to ensure that only rows meeting all three criteria are returned:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"operator\": \"ALL\",\n   \"arguments\": [\n       {\n           \"operator\": \"IN_LIST\",\n           \"column\": \"Category\",\n           \"values\": [\"Electronics\", \"Clothing\"]\n       },\n       {\n           \"operator\": \"IN_RANGE\",\n           \"column\": \"Price\",\n           \"min_val\": 10,\n           \"max_val\": 100\n       },\n       {\n           \"operator\": \"IN_RANGE\",\n           \"column\": \"Rating\",\n           \"min_val\": 4,\n           \"max_val\": 5\n       }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the filter would return rows that satisfy all three conditions simultaneously. This is useful for applying multiple filtering criteria to narrow down the dataset based on complex requirements.",
