      "You can use the Node.js `fs` (File System) module to list the contents of a directory. Here's a simple Node.js script to do that:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst directoryPath = '/path/to/your/directory'; // Replace with the path to the directory you want to list\n\nfs.readdir(directoryPath, (err, files) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error('Error reading directory:', err);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  files.forEach(file => {\n    console.log(file);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'/path/to/your/directory'` with the actual path of the directory you want to list. When you run this script, it will list the names of all files and subdirectories in the specified directory.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the code:\n\n1. We require the `fs` and `path` modules to work with the file system and handle file paths.\n2. Replace `'/path/to/your/directory'` with the path to the directory you want to list.\n3. We use `fs.readdir()` to read the contents of the specified directory.\n4. The callback function is called when the directory's contents are read. It receives an array of file and directory names in the `files` parameter.\n5. We loop through the array of file and directory names and log each one to the console.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will display the names of all files and subdirectories in the specified directory."
