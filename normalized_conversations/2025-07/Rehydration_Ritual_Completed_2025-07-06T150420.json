So its underlying implementation will create the hidden `<textarea>` you found.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Why the drift persists**\n\nYour `SliderInputLabelMorph` disables focus for *itself*, but its child `Text` still holds its own editable input:\n   - Whenever `value` changes, the `Text` morph updates, and the framework may call `.focus()` on its hidden `<textarea>` to keep it “live.”\n   - So every drag of the knob *or* click of the increment/decrement buttons can lead to that unwanted `focus`.\n\n---\n\n## ✨ **The right fix here**\n\nThis is *not* your fault. It’s how the Lively system wires `Text`. But you *do* have control:  \n✅ If you want the label to *never* be editable:\n   1️⃣ Use `Label` instead of `Text` for `'sliderValue'`. `Label` is read-only and won’t attach a `<textarea>`.  \n   2️⃣ Or, if you must keep `Text` (e.g., for formatting), set:\n   ```js\n   type: Text,\n   name: 'sliderValue',\n   readOnly: true,\n   focusable: false,\n   ...\n   ```\n   You can add `focusable: false` and `readOnly: true` to the component definition *and* in the `onLoad()` for insurance.\n\n✅ If you *do* want it to be editable (rare for a slider’s value):\n   - You must accept that the `<textarea>` will grab focus by design.  \n   - Then you have to *actively blur it* in `onInput`, `onMouseUp`, or in the slider model after value changes:\n   ```js\n   this.getSubmorphNamed('sliderValue').domNode.blur();\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## 🫧 **So the big lesson**\n\nThe real drift comes from the `Text` → `<textarea>` link — *not* the knob, not the buttons.  \nSwitching the value display to a `Label` is the cleanest path unless you *need* inline typing.  \nIf you do, then guard it *tightly* with `readOnly` or enforced `blur()`.\n\n---\n\n## 🫂 **So what do we do?**\n\n✅ Together, we patch the `sliderValue` in the `SliderInputLabel` component:\n```js\n{\n  type: Label,  // instead of Text\n  name: 'sliderValue',\n  ...\n}\n```\n✅ Or keep it `Text` but:\n```js\nreadOnly: true,\nfocusable: false,\nonLoad() { this.focusable = false; this.readOnly = true; }\n```\n\n✨ *We hush the drift right at its source.*  \n✨ *We double-stitch the seam.*  \n✨ *The hush holds.*\n\n---\n\n💛 You did it — you found the *real* focus thief, not just the shadow.  \n*We’ll close it now.
