      "The `bigquery.LoadJobConfig` class in the Google Cloud BigQuery API represents the configuration options for a load job, which loads data from an external source into a BigQuery table. \n\nThe `bigquery.LoadJobConfig` class has the following parameters that can be set:\n\n- `allow_jagged_rows` (bool): Whether to accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns.\n- `allow_quoted_newlines` (bool): Whether to allow quoted data containing newline characters (default is `False`).\n- `autodetect` (bool): Whether to automatically detect schema and input format options. If `True`, the schema and format options are inferred from the source data.\n- `clustering_fields` (List[str]): The names of columns used to cluster the data in the table.\n- `create_disposition` (str): Specifies the behavior when the destination table already exists. Possible values are `CREATE_IF_NEEDED` (default), `CREATE_NEVER`, and `CREATE_EMPTY`.\n- `encoding` (str): The character encoding of the source data. Default is `UTF-8`.\n- `field_delimiter` (str): The delimiter used between fields in the source data. Default is `,`.\n- `ignore_unknown_values` (bool): Whether to ignore values that do not match the schema. Default is `False`.\n- `max_bad_records` (int): The maximum number of bad records that are allowed to be encountered before the load job is aborted. Default is `0`, meaning no bad records are allowed.\n- `null_marker` (str): The string that represents a `NULL` value in the source data. Default is `None`.\n- `quote_character` (str): The character used to quote data sections in the source data. Default is `\"`.\n- `schema` (List[google.cloud.bigquery.schema.SchemaField]): The schema of the destination table. This can be set manually or inferred automatically if `autodetect` is `True`.\n- `schema_update_options` (List[str]): Specifies how to update the destination table schema. Possible values are `ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION`, `ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION`, and `ALLOW_FIELD_UPDATE`.\n- `skip_leading_rows` (int): The number of rows at the beginning of the source data to skip. Default is `0`.\n- `source_format` (str): The format of the source data. Possible values are `CSV`, `JSON`, `AVRO`, `PARQUET`, and `ORC`.\n- `time_partitioning` (google.cloud.bigquery.TimePartitioning): Specifies the partitioning of the destination table by time.\n- `write_disposition` (str): Specifies the behavior when writing to the destination table. Possible values are `WRITE_TRUNCATE` (default), `WRITE_APPEND`, and `WRITE_EMPTY`.\n\nNote that not all of these parameters are required and that some are mutually exclusive. For example, if `autodetect` is `True`, then the `schema` parameter should not be set manually. Similarly, if `time_partitioning` is set, then `clustering_fields` cannot be set."

      "In Google Cloud BigQuery, you can set the priority for a load job by specifying it in the `bigquery.LoadJobConfig` object when you create the job. The `bigquery.LoadJobConfig` object has a `priority` property that can be set to one of the following values:\n\n- `bigquery.QueryPriority.BATCH`: This is the default value and indicates that the load job should be run at a normal priority level. This means that the job will be processed in the order it was received, but may be delayed if the system is under heavy load.\n- `bigquery.QueryPriority.INTERACTIVE`: This indicates that the load job should be run at a higher priority level. This means that the job will be processed more quickly, but may use more resources and incur higher costs.\n\nTo set the priority for a load job, you can create a `bigquery.LoadJobConfig` object and set its `priority` property to the desired value before passing it to the `bigquery.Client.load_table_from_uri()` method, like this:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\n\nclient = bigquery.Client()\nconfig = bigquery.LoadJobConfig()\nconfig.priority = bigquery.QueryPriority.INTERACTIVE\n\njob = client.load_table_from_uri(\n    'gs://my-bucket/my-data.csv',\n    'my-project.my_dataset.my_table',\n    job_config=config\n)\n\njob.result() # Wait for the job to complete\n```\n\nIn this example, the `config` object is created with an `INTERACTIVE` priority, indicating that the load job should be processed more quickly. The `config` object is then passed to the `job_config` parameter of the `load_table_from_uri()` method, along with the source URI and destination table. The `job.result()` method is called to wait for the job to complete before continuing with the rest of the code."

      "In Python, you can use the `time` module to time how long it takes for a piece of code to run. Specifically, you can use the `time.time()` function to get the current time in seconds since the epoch, and then subtract the start time from the end time to get the elapsed time.\n\nHere is an example of how to time a piece of code in Python:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nstart_time = time.time()\n\n# Your code goes here\n\nend_time = time.time()\nelapsed_time = end_time - start_time\n\nprint(f\"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `start_time` variable is set to the current time using the `time.time()` function before the code to be timed is executed. After the code is executed, the `end_time` variable is set to the current time again, and the elapsed time is calculated by subtracting the `start_time` from the `end_time`. Finally, the elapsed time is printed to the console.\n\nNote that the elapsed time is calculated in seconds, so if you want to measure the time in a different unit (e.g. milliseconds), you can multiply the elapsed time by a conversion factor. For example, to get the elapsed time in milliseconds, you can multiply the elapsed time by 1000:\n\n```python\nelapsed_time_ms = elapsed_time * 1000\nprint(f\"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time_ms} milliseconds\")\n```"
