      "\n\nRick McGeer is a Canadian neuroscientist, pharmacologist, and biotech entrepreneur known for his pioneering work in the field of Alzheimer's disease research and drug discovery. He was born on September 16, 1933, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, as Patrick C. McGeer, but later changed his first name to Rick.\n\nMcGeer obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in 1955 and his PhD in pharmacology in 1959, both from the University of British Columbia. After completing his postdoctoral training in the United States at the University of California, San Francisco, and the National Institutes of Health, he returned to Canada in 1961 to join the faculty of the University of British Columbia.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, McGeer conducted groundbreaking research in the field of neuropharmacology, studying the effects of various drugs on the brain and nervous system. In the early 1980s, he shifted his focus to the study of Alzheimer's disease, which was then a relatively unknown condition.\n\nTogether with his wife, Edith McGeer, who is also a neuroscientist, Rick McGeer was among the first to propose the now widely accepted idea that inflammation plays a critical role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. They also discovered that the brain produces its own immune system-like cells, called microglia, which are involved in the inflammation response.\n\nMcGeer's research laid the foundation for the development of a new class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In the 1990s, he co-founded a biotech company called Neurogenetics, which was focused on developing new drugs for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. The company was later acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\nIn addition to his work in academia and industry, McGeer has also been a prominent advocate for science and research in Canada. He has served on numerous advisory committees and boards, including the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences.\n\nThroughout his career, McGeer has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to science, including the Order of Canada, the highest civilian honor in the country. He has also been inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame and the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame.\n\nNow in his nineties, Rick McGeer continues to be actively involved in research and remains a respected voice in the scientific community. His work has helped to advance our understanding of Alzheimer's disease and has paved the way for the development of new treatments that may one day cure this devastating condition."
