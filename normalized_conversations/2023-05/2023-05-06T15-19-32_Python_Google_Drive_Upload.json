Assign the appropriate roles to the service account based on what APIs and services you plan to use.\n\n6. Click on the \"Create key\" button to create a new key for the service account. Choose the JSON format and save the key file to a safe location on your computer.\n\n7. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the JSON key file. For example, on Linux or macOS:\n\n   ```\n   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/key.json\n   ```\n\n   On Windows:\n\n   ```\n   set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\\path\\to\\key.json\n   ```\n\n   You can set this environment variable in your terminal or in a script before running your Python code.\n\nOnce you've set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, you can use the `google-auth` library to authenticate your Python code. Here's an example of how to use it to create a Drive API client:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom google.oauth2 import service_account\nfrom googleapiclient.discovery import build\n\n# Set up credentials from environment variable\ncredentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'])\n\n# Set up Drive API client\napi_service_name = 'drive'\napi_version = 'v3'\nclient = build(api_service_name, api_version, credentials=credentials)\n\n# Use the client to make API requests\n# ...\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file()` method to create a `Credentials` object from the JSON key file specified in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. We then pass this credentials object to the `build()` method of the `googleapiclient.discovery` module to create a client object that we can use to make API requests.\n\nNote that the `google-auth` and `google-api-python-client` libraries need to be installed in your Python environment in order for this code to work. You can install them using pip:\n\n```\npip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client\n```"
