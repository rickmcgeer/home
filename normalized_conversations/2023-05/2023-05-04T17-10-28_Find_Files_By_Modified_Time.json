Here's an example code snippet that finds all files in the current directory that were modified on May 1st, 2023:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport datetime\n\ntarget_date = datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 1)\n\nfor filename in os.listdir('.'):\n    path = os.path.join('.', filename)\n    if os.path.isfile(path):\n        modified_time = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(path))\n        if modified_time.date() == target_date.date():\n            print(filename)\n```\n\nIn this example, we use `os.listdir` to iterate over all files in the current directory, and `os.path.isfile` to check that each item is a file (not a directory). Then we use `os.path.getmtime` to get the modification time of each file, and `datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp` to convert it to a `datetime` object. Finally, we check if the date of the modified time matches our target date, and print the filename if it does."
