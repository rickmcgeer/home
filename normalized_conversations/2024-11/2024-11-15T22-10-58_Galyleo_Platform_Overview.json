Open-source projects evolve at the speed of the community—unleashing the creativity, innovation, and collaboration of a global network of contributors. This pace far outstrips the progress of closed-source projects, which are limited by the resources and vision of a single vendor.  \n\nThis is why our **Galyleo Platform** is, and always will be, **100% open-source**. By embracing open source, we invite the collective ingenuity of developers, designers, and users worldwide to continually enhance and refine our platform. The result? A solution that reflects the very best ideas, tools, and practices the global community has to offer.  \n\nOpen source isn’t just a development model for us—it’s a philosophy. It ensures transparency, fosters trust, and empowers our customers to benefit from an ecosystem that’s constantly improving, adapting, and innovating.  \n\nWhen you choose Galyleo, you’re not just choosing a platform—you’re becoming part of a dynamic community that’s reshaping the way technology supports business. Together, we’re building the future, faster and better than ever before.  "
