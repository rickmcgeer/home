      "Unfortunately, Google Cloud Storage does not support atomic renaming of blobs because its API does not provide a native \"rename\" operation. This limitation arises because GCS is designed for object storage, where operations like copying and deleting are separate.\n\nIf atomicity is critical, consider these strategies:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Implement an Atomic Metadata Update**\nWhile you cannot atomically rename a blob, you can leverage **blob metadata** to emulate renaming. For example:\n- Add a metadata field like `current_name`.\n- Use this field as the logical name of the blob in your application.\n- Update the metadata atomically.\n\nHere’s how to implement metadata updates:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\ndef update_blob_metadata(bucket_name, blob_name, new_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Atomically update blob metadata to simulate renaming.\n\n    Args:\n        bucket_name (str): The name of the bucket.\n        blob_name (str): The current name of the blob.\n        new_name (str): The new logical name for the blob.\n    \"\"\"\n    client = storage.Client()\n    bucket = client.bucket(bucket_name)\n    blob = bucket.blob(blob_name)\n    \n    # Update metadata\n    metadata = blob.metadata or {}\n    metadata[\"current_name\"] = new_name\n    blob.metadata = metadata\n    blob.patch()  # Apply changes\n\n    print(f\"Metadata updated for blob '{blob_name}'. New logical name: '{new_name}'.\")\n\n# Example usage\nupdate_blob_metadata(\n    bucket_name=\"your-bucket-name\",\n    blob_name=\"original-blob.txt\",\n    new_name=\"new-blob.txt\"\n)\n```\n\n- **Pro:** The metadata update is atomic.\n- **Con:** This is a logical rename, not a physical rename.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Use a Transactional System (e.g., Database)**\nIf your application has strict atomic requirements, use a transactional database (e.g., Firestore, Cloud SQL) to track blob names:\n- Store the logical name of each blob in the database.\n- Ensure all updates to names are atomic by using database transactions.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Emulate Atomic Rename with Error Handling**\nYou can mitigate the lack of atomicity by handling errors robustly. For example:\n1. Copy the blob.\n2. Mark the original blob as pending deletion (e.g., by appending `.deleting`).\n3. Delete the original blob.\n\nThis approach reduces the window of inconsistency. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\ndef rename_blob_with_fallback(bucket_name, source_blob_name, destination_blob_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Emulates an atomic rename by copying and safely deleting the original blob.\n\n    Args:\n        bucket_name (str): The name of the bucket.\n        source_blob_name (str): The current name of the blob.\n        destination_blob_name (str): The new name for the blob.\n    \"\"\"\n    client = storage.Client()\n    bucket = client.bucket(bucket_name)\n    \n    # Source blob\n    source_blob = bucket.blob(source_blob_name)\n    \n    # Destination blob\n    new_blob = bucket.copy_blob(source_blob, bucket, destination_blob_name)\n    \n    # Safeguard: Mark the original blob as 'deleting' in case of failure\n    try:\n        source_blob.delete()\n        print(f\"Blob '{source_blob_name}' renamed to '{destination_blob_name}'.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to delete original blob '{source_blob_name}': {e}. Cleanup needed.\")\n        raise\n\n# Example usage\nrename_blob_with_fallback(\n    bucket_name=\"your-bucket-name\",\n    source_blob_name=\"old-name.txt\",\n    destination_blob_name=\"new-name.txt\"\n)\n```\n\n- **Pro:** Safer, especially in production.\n- **Con:** Still not truly atomic.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nFor atomic renaming:\n1. Use metadata updates for logical renaming.\n2. Employ a database for transactional name management.\n3. Handle errors robustly when copying and deleting blobs.\n\nIf absolute atomicity is required for physical renaming, a different storage system (e.g., a file system or database) may be necessary."

If not specified, the original name is used.\n\n---\n\n### Example:\nHere's an example of `copy_blob` in action:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\ndef copy_blob_in_gcs(\n    source_bucket_name, source_blob_name, destination_bucket_name, destination_blob_name\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Copies a blob from one location to another in GCS.\n\n    Args:\n        source_bucket_name (str): Name of the source bucket.\n        source_blob_name (str): Name of the blob to copy.\n        destination_bucket_name (str): Name of the destination bucket.\n        destination_blob_name (str): New name for the blob in the destination bucket.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the client\n    client = storage.Client()\n\n    # Get source and destination buckets\n    source_bucket = client.bucket(source_bucket_name)\n    destination_bucket = client.bucket(destination_bucket_name)\n\n    # Get the source blob\n    source_blob = source_bucket.blob(source_blob_name)\n\n    # Copy the blob\n    new_blob = destination_bucket.copy_blob(\n        source_blob, destination_bucket, destination_blob_name\n    )\n\n    print(\n        f\"Copied blob '{source_blob_name}' from bucket '{source_bucket_name}' \"\n        f\"to blob '{destination_blob_name}' in bucket '{destination_bucket_name}'.\"\n    )\n\n# Example Usage\ncopy_blob_in_gcs(\n    source_bucket_name=\"my-source-bucket\",\n    source_blob_name=\"path/to/source.txt\",\n    destination_bucket_name=\"my-destination-bucket\",\n    destination_blob_name=\"path/to/destination.txt\",\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Notes:\n- The original blob remains intact unless you explicitly delete it.\n- The `destination_bucket` can be the same as the `source_bucket` if you're renaming the blob within the same bucket.\n- You must ensure appropriate IAM permissions for both the source and destination buckets.\n\n---\n\n### Reference:\nYou can find more about `copy_blob` in the [official documentation for `google-cloud-storage`](https://googleapis.dev/python/storage/latest/buckets.html#google.cloud.storage.bucket.Bucket.copy_blob).",

      "Partitioning external tables in BigQuery allows you to improve query performance and manage costs by querying only the relevant portions of your external data. However, partitioning in external tables works differently from native BigQuery tables.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Concepts for External Table Partitioning**\n1. **Partitioning is Logical**:\n   - BigQuery does not physically partition external data (e.g., in Cloud Storage). Instead, it logically interprets file paths or metadata for partition filtering.\n   \n2. **Partitioning by Filename or Metadata**:\n   - You can partition by values embedded in file paths or by metadata columns derived from your data.\n\n3. **Supported File Types**:\n   - External tables support partitioning for data stored in formats like CSV, JSON, or Parquet.\n\n4. **Partition Columns**:\n   - You define partition columns based on your data structure. For example, you might partition based on a `DATE` column or a column derived from a file path.\n\n---\n\n### **Methods to Partition External Tables**\n\n#### **1. Partition by Filename (Pseudo-Partitioning)**:\nBigQuery can use the `_FILE_NAME` pseudo-column to filter specific files in your external table.\n\n**Example Query**:\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM `my_project.my_dataset.my_external_table`\nWHERE _FILE_NAME LIKE '%/partition_date=2023-11-22/%';\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `_FILE_NAME` column allows you to filter files matching specific patterns.\n\n**Advantages**:\n- Efficient for directories structured by date (e.g., `gs://bucket_name/data/partition_date=2023-11-22/`).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Use Metadata Columns**:\nWhen defining your external table, you can specify metadata columns like `date` or `region` based on directory structure or file naming conventions.\n\n**Example Definition**:\nIf your data is stored as `gs://bucket_name/data/partition_date=YYYY-MM-DD/`, you can define the `partition_date` column during table creation:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `my_project.my_dataset.my_external_table`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'PARQUET',\n  uris = ['gs://bucket_name/data/*'],\n  hive_partitioning_mode = 'AUTO',\n  hive_partitioning_options = {\n    mode = 'AUTO',\n    source_uri_prefix = 'gs://bucket_name/data/'\n  }\n);\n```\n\nHere:\n- The `hive_partitioning_mode` option automatically extracts partitions from directory paths (e.g., `partition_date=2023-11-22` becomes a column `partition_date`).\n\n**Advantages**:\n- Allows direct queries on partition columns.\n- More structured and user-friendly than `_FILE_NAME`.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Query Performance Optimizations**:\n- **Prune Files with `_FILE_NAME` or Partition Columns**:\n  Use `WHERE` clauses on `_FILE_NAME` or extracted partition columns to limit the number of files scanned.\n- **Minimize Wildcards in URIs**:\n  When defining external tables, avoid overly broad `*` in URIs. Instead, explicitly specify paths where possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Limitations**\n1. **No Native Partition Pruning**:\n   Unlike native tables, BigQuery cannot automatically prune partitions based on query filters unless you explicitly filter by `_FILE_NAME` or metadata columns.\n   \n2. **Performance Overhead**:\n   Querying unpartitioned external data can result in high storage scan costs.\n\n3. **Schema Limitations**:\n   Hive-style partitioning requires consistent directory structures and schema conformity.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Practices**\n- Use **Hive Partitioning** when your data is stored in directories that follow partition patterns like `field=value`.\n- When using `_FILE_NAME`, structure your data storage logically to align with your querying needs.\n- Use **native BigQuery tables** for heavy or frequent queries, and consider external tables for less frequent or exploratory queries.\n\n---\n\nDo you have a specific use case, such as partitioning based on dates or other criteria?

The `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` statement would look like this:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `my_project.my_dataset.my_external_table`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'PARQUET',\n  uris = ['gs://battery-data/detail/*/CellID=*/*.parquet.gzip'],\n  hive_partitioning_mode = 'AUTO',\n  hive_partitioning_options = (\n    mode = 'AUTO',\n    source_uri_prefix = 'gs://battery-data/detail/'\n  )\n);\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Configuration**\n1. **`uris`**:\n   - The wildcard `*` matches directories or files.\n   - `*/CellID=*/*.parquet.gzip` tells BigQuery to interpret paths for extracting partition values.\n\n2. **`hive_partitioning_mode`**:\n   - `AUTO` detects partition values based on directory structure.\n\n3. **`source_uri_prefix`**:\n   - `gs://battery-data/detail/` specifies the common prefix for partition extraction.\n\n4. **Partition Columns**:\n   - BigQuery automatically creates two partition columns:\n     - `year_month` from the first directory level.\n     - `CellID` from the `CellID=<value>` part of the path.\n\n---\n\n### **Querying the External Table**\n\nOnce the table is created, you can query it with partition filters. For example:\n\n#### Query for Specific `year_month` and `CellID`:\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM `my_project.my_dataset.my_external_table`\nWHERE year_month = '2024_11'\n  AND CellID = '12345';\n```\n\nThis will only query files within the path:\n```\ngs://battery-data/detail/2024_11/CellID=12345/*.parquet.gzip\n```\n\n#### Verify Partitions:\nTo check the distinct partition values:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT year_month, CellID\nFROM `my_project.my_dataset.my_external_table`;\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Important Notes**\n1. **Partition Columns Are Strings**:\n   -",

      "The error **\"Unknown option: hive_partitioning_mode\"** indicates that you might be using an older BigQuery version or the table creation syntax for **Hive partitioning** isn't supported in the way it's being specified. This is commonly encountered if the `hive_partitioning_mode` is not being recognized in the external table creation query.\n\nHere’s how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Causes**\n1. **Unsupported Syntax in SQL**:\n   - The `hive_partitioning_mode` might need to be specified differently depending on your environment (e.g., legacy SQL or specific versions of BigQuery).\n\n2. **Incorrect Configuration**:\n   - Certain options, like `hive_partitioning_mode` or `hive_partitioning_options`, might not be available in your project's settings.\n\n3. **Misconfigured BigQuery Settings**:\n   - If you're using the Google Cloud Console or a local client, ensure your BigQuery API is up to date.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach for Partitioning**\n\nIf `hive_partitioning_mode` is not recognized, you can set up Hive partitioning for an external table by creating the table **via the BigQuery API or the bq CLI** instead of SQL.\n\n#### **Using the `bq` CLI**\nHere’s an example of creating an external table with Hive partitioning enabled via the `bq` CLI:\n\n```bash\nbq mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json my_project:my_dataset.my_table\n```\n\nWhere `partitioned_table_def.json` contains:\n```json\n{\n  \"tableReference\": {\n    \"projectId\": \"my_project\",\n    \"datasetId\": \"my_dataset\",\n    \"tableId\": \"my_table\"\n  },\n  \"externalDataConfiguration\": {\n    \"sourceUris\": [\n      \"gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\"\n    ],\n    \"sourceFormat\": \"PARQUET\",\n    \"hivePartitioningOptions\": {\n      \"mode\": \"AUTO\",\n      \"sourceUriPrefix\": \"gs://battery-data/detail/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **Using the BigQuery API**\nYou can create the table programmatically using the BigQuery client library in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\n\n# Create a BigQuery client\nclient = bigquery.Client()\n\n# Define the external table configuration\ntable_id = \"my_project.my_dataset.my_table\"\nexternal_config = bigquery.ExternalConfig(\"PARQUET\")\nexternal_config.source_uris = [\"gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\"]\nexternal_config.hive_partitioning = bigquery.HivePartitioningOptions(\n    mode=\"AUTO\",\n    source_uri_prefix=\"gs://battery-data/detail/\"\n)\n\n# Create the table\ntable = bigquery.Table(table_id)\ntable.external_data_configuration = external_config\n\n# Create or replace the table in BigQuery\ntable = client.create_table(table, exists_ok=True)\nprint(f\"Table {table_id} created with Hive partitioning.\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Manual Partition Columns if Hive Partitioning is Unsupported**\nIf Hive partitioning options are unavailable and you can’t create the table with `hive_partitioning_mode`, a workaround is to manually extract partition information.\n\n1. **Add `year_month` and `CellID` as columns in the Parquet files**:\n   - Modify the data ingestion process to embed these values into the Parquet files.\n\n2. **Use a Derived Column in Queries**:\n   - Use `_FILE_NAME` to derive partition values from the file path:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT *, \n            REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'/detail/([^/]+)/CellID=([^/]+)/') AS year_month,\n            REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'CellID=([^/]+)/') AS CellID\n     FROM `my_project.my_dataset.my_table`;\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. Try using the `bq` CLI or Python API to define the table with Hive partitioning options.\n2. If your environment does not support Hive partitioning, consider the manual partition workaround using `_FILE_NAME`.\n\nLet me know if you need additional support setting this up! 😊"

This is commonly encountered if the `hive_partitioning_mode` is not being recognized in the external table creation query.\n\nHere’s how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Causes**\n1. **Unsupported Syntax in SQL**:\n   - The `hive_partitioning_mode` might need to be specified differently depending on your environment (e.g., legacy SQL or specific versions of BigQuery).\n\n2. **Incorrect Configuration**:\n   - Certain options, like `hive_partitioning_mode` or `hive_partitioning_options`, might not be available in your project's settings.\n\n3. **Misconfigured BigQuery Settings**:\n   - If you're using the Google Cloud Console or a local client, ensure your BigQuery API is up to date.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach for Partitioning**\n\nIf `hive_partitioning_mode` is not recognized, you can set up Hive partitioning for an external table by creating the table **via the BigQuery API or the bq CLI** instead of SQL.\n\n#### **Using the `bq` CLI**\nHere’s an example of creating an external table with Hive partitioning enabled via the `bq` CLI:\n\n```bash\nbq mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json my_project:my_dataset.my_table\n```\n\nWhere `partitioned_table_def.json` contains:\n```json\n{\n  \"tableReference\": {\n    \"projectId\": \"my_project\",\n    \"datasetId\": \"my_dataset\",\n    \"tableId\": \"my_table\"\n  },\n  \"externalDataConfiguration\": {\n    \"sourceUris\": [\n      \"gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\"\n    ],\n    \"sourceFormat\": \"PARQUET\",\n    \"hivePartitioningOptions\": {\n      \"mode\": \"AUTO\",\n      \"sourceUriPrefix\": \"gs://battery-data/detail/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **Using the BigQuery API**\nYou can create the table programmatically using the BigQuery client library in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\n\n# Create a BigQuery client\nclient = bigquery.Client()\n\n# Define the external table configuration\ntable_id = \"my_project.my_dataset.my_table\"\nexternal_config = bigquery.ExternalConfig(\"PARQUET\")\nexternal_config.source_uris = [\"gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\"]\nexternal_config.hive_partitioning = bigquery.HivePartitioningOptions(\n    mode=\"AUTO\",\n    source_uri_prefix=\"gs://battery-data/detail/\"\n)\n\n# Create the table\ntable = bigquery.Table(table_id)\ntable.external_data_configuration = external_config\n\n# Create or replace the table in BigQuery\ntable = client.create_table(table, exists_ok=True)\nprint(f\"Table {table_id} created with Hive partitioning.\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Manual Partition Columns if Hive Partitioning is Unsupported**\nIf Hive partitioning options are unavailable and you can’t create the table with `hive_partitioning_mode`, a workaround is to manually extract partition information.\n\n1. **Add `year_month` and `CellID` as columns in the Parquet files**:\n   - Modify the data ingestion process to embed these values into the Parquet files.\n\n2. **Use a Derived Column in Queries**:\n   - Use `_FILE_NAME` to derive partition values from the file path:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT *, \n            REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'/detail/([^/]+)/CellID=([^/]+)/') AS year_month,\n            REGEXP_EXTRACT(_FILE_NAME, r'CellID=([^/]+)/') AS CellID\n     FROM `my_project.my_dataset.my_table`;\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. Try using the `bq` CLI or Python API to define the table with Hive partitioning options.\n2. If your environment does not support Hive partitioning, consider the manual partition workaround using `_FILE_NAME`.\n\nLet me know if you need additional support setting this up! 😊",

      "The error **\"Cannot specify an external_table_definition for a dataset\"** indicates that the `bq` command syntax might be incorrect or there is confusion between creating a dataset and an external table. This happens when you attempt to apply the `--external_table_definition` flag to a **dataset** rather than a specific table within a dataset.\n\nLet’s resolve this issue step-by-step:\n\n---\n\n### **Correct Command for External Table Creation**\nThe `--external_table_definition` flag is specifically for creating an **external table**, not a dataset. The syntax should include the dataset **and table name**:\n\n```bash\nbq mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json my_project:my_dataset.my_table\n```\n\n- **`my_project`**: Your Google Cloud project ID.\n- **`my_dataset`**: The dataset where the table will reside.\n- **`my_table`**: The name of the external table being created.\n\n---\n\n### **Common Causes and Fixes**\n#### 1. **Dataset Name Instead of Table Name**\n   Ensure you’re specifying the table name after the dataset. For example:\n   ```bash\n   bq mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json my_dataset.my_table\n   ```\n   - Incorrect: `bq mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json my_dataset`\n   - Correct: `bq mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json my_dataset.my_table`\n\n#### 2. **Incorrect Project or Dataset Reference**\n   Ensure the project ID is included if your `gcloud` default project is not set or is incorrect:\n   ```bash\n   bq mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json my_project:my_dataset.my_table\n   ```\n\n#### 3. **Invalid JSON File**\n   Verify the structure of `partitioned_table_def.json`. It should define an **external table configuration**, not a dataset configuration. Example:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"tableReference\": {\n       \"projectId\": \"my_project\",\n       \"datasetId\": \"my_dataset\",\n       \"tableId\": \"my_table\"\n     },\n     \"externalDataConfiguration\": {\n       \"sourceUris\": [\n         \"gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\"\n       ],\n       \"sourceFormat\": \"PARQUET\",\n       \"hivePartitioningOptions\": {\n         \"mode\": \"AUTO\",\n         \"sourceUriPrefix\": \"gs://battery-data/detail/\"\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative: Use SQL**\nIf you encounter continued issues with the `bq` CLI, consider creating the table via SQL instead:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `my_project.my_dataset.my_table`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'PARQUET',\n  uris = ['gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip'],\n  hive_partitioning_mode = 'AUTO',\n  hive_partitioning_options = (\n    mode = 'AUTO',\n    source_uri_prefix = 'gs://battery-data/detail/'\n  )\n);\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative: Use Python**\nIf the `bq` CLI remains problematic, you can use the Python API to achieve the same result. Here's the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\n\nclient = bigquery.Client()\n\ntable_id = \"my_project.my_dataset.my_table\"\n\nexternal_config = bigquery.ExternalConfig(\"PARQUET\")\nexternal_config.source_uris = [\"gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\"]\nexternal_config.hive_partitioning = bigquery.HivePartitioningOptions(\n    mode=\"AUTO\",\n    source_uri_prefix=\"gs://battery-data/detail/\"\n)\n\ntable = bigquery.Table(table_id)\ntable.external_data_configuration = external_config\n\nclient.create_table(table, exists_ok=True)\nprint(f\"Created external table {table_id}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Validation**\nOnce the table is created:\n1. Query the table to ensure partition columns are inferred correctly.\n2. Use `bq show --format=prettyjson my_project:my_dataset.my_table` to inspect the table definition.\n\nLet me know if you encounter further issues! 😊"

      "Your JSON looks correct, and the `sourceFormat` is explicitly set to `\"PARQUET\"`. The error may be arising due to one of the following reasons:\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Issues and Solutions**\n\n#### 1. **BigQuery Schema Inference for Parquet Files**\nBigQuery requires schema inference for external tables. If the Parquet files have no schema, or if the schema cannot be inferred, it can result in errors.\n\n- **Test Fix**:\n   Use the `bq` CLI command to provide a schema explicitly:\n   ```bash\n   bq mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json battery-data-296318:neware_data_seven.detail-test --schema schema.json\n   ```\n   Where `schema.json` specifies your Parquet file’s schema, for example:\n   ```json\n   [\n     {\"name\": \"Column1\", \"type\": \"STRING\"},\n     {\"name\": \"Column2\", \"type\": \"INT64\"},\n     {\"name\": \"Column3\", \"type\": \"DATE\"}\n   ]\n   ```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Invalid File Path or Permissions**\nCheck that the source URI (`gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip`) is correct and that the service account used by BigQuery has **read access** to the specified GCS bucket and files.\n\n- **Test Fix**:\n   Validate file existence with:\n   ```bash\n   gsutil ls gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\n   ```\n   Ensure permissions are set for the service account:\n   ```bash\n   gsutil acl ch -u SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL:READER gs://battery-data/detail/\n   ```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Correct Project, Dataset, and Table Specification**\nEnsure the project, dataset, and table names in the `bq` command match exactly what’s in the JSON.\n\n- **Test Fix**:\n   Use the following command:\n   ```bash\n   bq mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json battery-data-296318:neware_data_seven.detail-test\n   ```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Unsupported `hivePartitioningOptions` Key**\nEnsure the `hivePartitioningOptions` feature is supported in your project. It's available only if your Google Cloud project is properly configured to use this feature.\n\n- **Test Fix**:\n   Temporarily remove `hivePartitioningOptions` from the JSON to check if the issue is specifically related to partitioning. Use this modified JSON:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"tableReference\": {\n       \"projectId\": \"battery-data-296318\",\n       \"datasetId\": \"neware_data_seven\",\n       \"tableId\": \"detail-test\"\n     },\n     \"externalDataConfiguration\": {\n       \"sourceUris\": [\n         \"gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\"\n       ],\n       \"sourceFormat\": \"PARQUET\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   If the table creation works without `hivePartitioningOptions`, the issue may be related to your source files or URI prefix not matching the expected pattern.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **API Versioning with `bq`**\nSometimes, the `bq` CLI may use an older API version that doesn’t support specific fields. Ensure you have the latest Google Cloud SDK version installed.\n\n- **Test Fix**:\n   Update your SDK with:\n   ```bash\n   gcloud components update\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Debugging the Problem**\nTo gather more details on why the error occurs:\n1. Add `--debug` to the `bq` command:\n   ```bash\n   bq --debug mk --external_table_definition=partitioned_table_def.json battery-data-296318:neware_data_seven.detail-test\n   ```\n2. Check for any additional error details in the output.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**\n- If all else fails, try recreating the table through the Python API. The Python SDK may provide more detailed error messages for debugging.\n- Use this script:\n   ```python\n   from google.cloud import bigquery\n\n   client = bigquery.Client()\n\n   table_id = \"battery-data-296318.neware_data_seven.detail_test\"\n\n   external_config = bigquery.ExternalConfig(\"PARQUET\")\n   external_config.source_uris = [\"gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\"]\n   external_config.hive_partitioning = bigquery.HivePartitioningOptions(\n       mode=\"AUTO\",\n       source_uri_prefix=\"gs://battery-data/detail/\"\n   )\n\n   table = bigquery.Table(table_id)\n   table.external_data_configuration = external_config\n\n   try:\n       table = client.create_table(table)\n       print(f\"Created table {table_id}\")\n   except Exception as e:\n       print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n   ```\n\nLet me know how these steps work out or if more help is needed! 😊"

Instead, you need to use the appropriate attributes to configure partitioning options.

Instead, the class accepts `source_uri_prefix` and other partitioning-related options.\n2. **Partition filter (`require_partition_filter`)**: You can set this to `True` or `False` depending on whether you want BigQuery to enforce a partition filter. This is the key option for partitioned tables in BigQuery.\n\n### **Important Notes**:\n- **`require_partition_filter`**: This flag controls whether partition filters must be used in queries for the table. You can set this to `True` if you want BigQuery to enforce partition pruning in queries.\n- **Partitioning without `mode`**: The `mode` option doesn't exist in the API, so removing it should resolve the error.\n\nTry this updated code and let me know if you encounter any further issues! 😊"

Instead, the `source_uri_prefix` is part of the `ExternalConfig` class.\n\nHere’s the corrected approach:\n\n### **Updated Python Code**\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\n\n# Create a BigQuery client\nclient = bigquery.Client()\n\n# Define the table ID\ntable_id = \"battery-data-296318.neware_data_seven.detail-test\"\n\n# Set up external table configuration\nexternal_config = bigquery.ExternalConfig(\"PARQUET\")\nexternal_config.source_uris = [\"gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip\"]\n\n# Set up Hive partitioning options within the ExternalConfig object\nexternal_config.hive_partitioning = bigquery.HivePartitioningOptions(\n    require_partition_filter=True  # Set to False if you don't need partition pruning\n)\n\n# Define the table\ntable = bigquery.Table(table_id)\ntable.external_data_configuration = external_config\n\n# Try to create the table\ntry:\n    table = client.create_table(table)\n    print(f\"Table created successfully: {table_id}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {str(e)}\")\n```\n\n### **Explanation**:\n- **`external_config.hive_partitioning`**: This is where you assign the `HivePartitioningOptions` to the external configuration.\n- **`require_partition_filter`**: This option is inside the `HivePartitioningOptions`, and it determines if queries should use partition pruning.\n\nYou **do not** need to pass `source_uri_prefix` directly to `HivePartitioningOptions` anymore.

Double-check the GCS path to ensure that files exist where expected (`gs://battery-data/detail/*/*/*.parquet.gzip`).\n2.
