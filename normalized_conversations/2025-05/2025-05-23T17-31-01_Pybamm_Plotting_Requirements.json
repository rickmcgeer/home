      "Yes, **PyBaMM** (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) includes built-in plotting functionality that assumes a graphics-capable environment, typically relying on **Matplotlib** for visualization. Here's what that means in practice:\n\n### 1. **Graphics Requirement**\n- PyBaMM’s plotting functions (e.g., `quick_plot`, `plot`, `DynamicPlot`) assume that a windowing or GUI backend is available to render plots.\n- This is true when running in:\n  - A **Jupyter notebook** (using an inline backend like `matplotlib inline` or `notebook`)\n  - A **local Python script** executed in a desktop environment\n- If you're on a **headless server** or running in a **non-GUI environment** (e.g., some Docker containers, CI pipelines, or SSH sessions), Matplotlib will raise an error unless configured properly.\n\n### 2. **Headless Use**\n- You can use PyBaMM in headless mode by setting a non-interactive backend:\n  ```python\n  import matplotlib\n  matplotlib.use(\"Agg\")  # Use the Anti-Grain Geometry backend (no display)\n  ```\n  This allows you to generate plots and save them to disk without displaying a GUI:\n  ```python\n  import pybamm\n  plot = pybamm.QuickPlot(solution)\n  plot.dynamic_plot()  # Still may require GUI\n  plt.savefig(\"plot.png\")\n  ```\n\n### 3. **Best Practice for Headless**\n- Avoid `QuickPlot` and `DynamicPlot` in headless mode; instead, extract data manually and use Matplotlib directly with `Agg` or similar:\n  ```python\n  t = solution[\"Time [s]\"].entries\n  v = solution[\"Terminal voltage [V]\"](t)\n  \n  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n  plt.plot(t, v)\n  plt.xlabel(\"Time [s]\")\n  plt.ylabel(\"Voltage [V]\")\n  plt.savefig(\"voltage.png\")\n  ```\n\n### Summary\nYes, PyBaMM's built-in plotting assumes a graphics-capable environment by default, but it can be used in headless environments with adjustments. If you're running in a headless context (e.g. server, pipeline, Docker), set the Matplotlib backend to a non-interactive one like `\"Agg\"` and avoid live/interactive plots."

      "Yes, **PyBaMM works very well inside Jupyter Notebooks** — and in fact, that's one of the **best and most common environments** for using it, especially for interactive modeling and visualization.
