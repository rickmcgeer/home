      "The **Global Data Plane (GDP)** is a foundational infrastructure designed to unify and simplify access to data from diverse sources—ranging from physical sensors and simulation outputs to distributed file collections and structured databases. At its core, the GDP acts as a universal connector that abstracts the location, format, and provenance of data, allowing users and applications to interact with data as a service rather than a product of specific tools or storage methods. This abstraction enables seamless data discovery, access, and integration across heterogeneous environments, eliminating the traditional silos created by proprietary formats, storage backends, or organizational boundaries. Whether the data originates from IoT devices, scientific simulations, or enterprise databases, the GDP presents a consistent interface for accessing it in real time or retrospectively.\n\nMuch like how the World Wide Web decoupled the act of document creation from document access—freeing users from needing the same software or system to read content—the GDP breaks the dependency between how and where data is collected and how it is later consumed. This paradigm shift makes data inherently shareable, composable, and secure, supporting collaborative analysis and resilient, data-driven systems at scale. Originally developed as part of the DARPA-funded **TerraSwarm Project**, the GDP was designed with a focus on scalability, security, and robustness in cyber-physical systems.

It is designed to be fast, efficient, and highly extensible, making it one of the most popular development tools across a wide range of programming communities.  The open-source version of Microsoft’s flagship developer product, Visual Studio, it is robust.

At its core, the Workbench delivers secure, containerized environments for running code and visualizations, but its real power lies in the rich ecosystem of tools and services it makes available by default.  \n\r\nOne of its most distinctive features is the integration of AgentAI services—autonomous agents that can perform complex tasks, coordinate workflows, and operate on behalf of users. These agents can assist in exploratory data analysis, automate repetitive modeling tasks, and even interface with external APIs or data platforms.

This means users can not only chat with AI assistants to refine ideas, debug code, or get suggestions, but can also embed large language models, image generators, and other AI capabilities directly into their analytics workflows.

Whether the agent is running inside the environment or as an external microservice, the Workbench ensures that it operates with the right permissions and full awareness of the user's identity and workspace context.  \n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTogether, the Ultisim Workbench and Environment form a powerful foundation for human-AI collaboration in data analytics, software engineering, and scientific research. By combining intelligent agents with programmable interfaces and robust identity management, UltisimUltiSim empowers users to go beyond manual exploration and development. Instead, they engage in an ongoing dialogue with AI that accelerates insight, enhances productivity, and opens new avenues for discovery. In this ecosystem, AI agents are not just tools—they are collaborators that help users think more clearly, build more efficiently, and solve problems faster than ever before. \nThe customer is hot on MBSE, so make one of the Key Results integration of MBSE, which mostly means SysML",

Agents must be able to read/write notebooks, run simulations, query datasets, and call APIs while adhering to user-specific permissions and workspace boundaries.\n\n- **KR4: Generative AI and Conversational Integration**  \n  Integrate conversational and generative AI tools (e.g., LLMs, image generators, code assistants) into the Workbench interface and APIs, enabling users to use natural language to generate code, summarize results, debug issues, and generate synthetic datasets—all within the same workflow.\n\n- **KR5: Cloud-Native, Zero-Client Architecture Validation**  \n  Validate that the UDAW runs on standard Web browsers across Windows, macOS, and low-end netbooks without client dependencies, and that all supported tools perform responsively and reliably in these environments under realistic load conditions.\n\n- **KR6: MBSE Integration via SysML Support**  \n  Demonstrate integration of Model-Based Systems Engineering capabilities by embedding Graphor and other SysML modeling tools directly into the Workbench. Ensure that models created or edited through these tools are accessible to AgentAI workflows and analytics pipelines, enabling closed-loop design-analysis-simulation-feedback cycles.\n\n- **KR7: Digital Twin-Oriented Service Composition**  \n  Provide a set of reusable, composable services within the Workbench that support digital twin lifecycle activities—including schema definition, simulation control, data ingestion, analysis, and visualization—enabling users to orchestrate entire digital twin workflows through the Workbench interface.\n\n---\n\nThese Key Results articulate both the technical and user-facing goals of the Ultisim Workbench and demonstrate its central role in enabling a frictionless, AI-augmented, MBSE-compliant analytics experience for digital twins."
