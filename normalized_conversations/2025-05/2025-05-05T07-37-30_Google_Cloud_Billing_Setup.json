      "To have your **customer directly pay for a Google Cloud project that you manage**, you can take the following approach. Since you already have a **Google Cloud Organization**, here's a clean breakdown of what **you need to do** and what **your customer needs to do**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ You Need to Do:\n\n#### 1. **Create a New Google Cloud Project**\n- Under your existing Organization (via the Google Cloud Console or `gcloud` CLI).\n\n#### 2. **Create a New Billing Account (Optional)**\n- If the customer will **own the billing account**, **you don't do this** — your customer will.\n- If they want to **give you access to an existing billing account**, they’ll need to add you as a Billing Account User or Admin.\n\n#### 3. **Give the Customer Billing Permissions**\nThere are **two common models** here — choose one based on trust and control:\n\n---\n\n#### 🔹 **Option A: Customer Owns the Billing Account**\n\n**They do this:**\n- Go to [Google Cloud Console → Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)\n- Create a **new billing account** if they don’t have one.\n- Add **you (or a service account you control)** as a **Billing Account User** (role: `roles/billing.user`) or **Billing Account Admin** (role: `roles/billing.admin`) if they want you to link projects.\n  - This is done under **Billing → Account Management → Permissions**.\n\n**You do this:**\n- Link your GCP project to their billing account:\n  - Go to **Billing → My Projects → Change billing account**\n  - Choose their account (you’ll only see it if you’ve been granted permission).\n\n---\n\n#### 🔹 **Option B: They Own the Project Directly**\n\nThis is only if **they want full ownership**, and you act as a contractor.\n\n**They do this:**\n- Create the project under their billing account.\n- Add **you** to the project with the necessary IAM roles (e.g., `Editor`, `Owner`, or a custom role).\n\n**You do:**\n- Manage the project as needed.\n\nThis is clean, but you lose project ownership/control.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Your Customer Needs to Do:\n\n- **Option A**: Own or create a **billing account**, and give you permission to attach your project to it.\n- **Option B**: Create the project and let you work inside it by granting IAM roles.\n\n---\n\n### ❗Important Notes:\n- **Billing accounts are global**, not tied to an organization.\n- Projects can only be linked to **one billing account** at a time.\n- **Billing account ownership = payment responsibility.**\n- If using **committed use discounts**, credits apply only at the billing account level.\n- Google Cloud support and quotas depend on billing setup too.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\nIf you want to **retain control of the project** while your customer pays, go with **Option A** — you create the project, and they own the billing account.\n\nWould you like help drafting a message or guide to send to your customer so they know what to do?"
