PORTS\nc3f279d17e0a   myapp:latest  \"/start.sh\"  ...   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp\n```\n\nThis tells you:\n- Port **80** inside the container is mapped to port **8080** on the host.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Inspect container for internal/exposed ports**\nRun this command:\n\n```bash\ndocker inspect <container_id_or_name>\n```\n\nTo filter the ports:\n\n```bash\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .NetworkSettings.Ports}}' <container_id_or_name>\n```\n\nThis will return something like:\n\n```json\n{\"80/tcp\":[{\"HostIp\":\"0.0.0.0\",\"HostPort\":\"8080\"}]}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Check Dockerfile or image definition**\nIf you're looking at the image before the container runs:\n\n```bash\ndocker inspect <image_name>\n```\n\nLook for the `ExposedPorts` section to see what ports the image declares.\n\n---\n\nWould you like help checking for ports in a `docker-compose.yml` or Kubernetes manifest too?"
