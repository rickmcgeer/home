      "To specify a region for a Google App Engine Standard Environment deployment, you need to set the region during the creation of your App Engine application, not during deployment. Once the region is set for an App Engine app, it cannot be changed.\n\nHere’s how to specify the region during the initial setup:\n\n### 1. **Create App Engine and Specify Region:**\n   If you haven't already created an App Engine application, run the following command in the Cloud SDK (`gcloud`):\n\n   ```bash\n   gcloud app create --region <region>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<region>` with your desired region (e.g., `us-central`, `europe-west`, etc.). For example, to create an App Engine application in `us-central`:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcloud app create --region us-central\n   ```\n\n   You can find a list of supported regions in the [App Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/locations).\n\n### 2. **Deploy Your Application:**\n   Once the App Engine application is created in your preferred region, you can deploy your app using:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcloud app deploy\n   ```\n\nAt this stage, the region is already set, and the deployment will go to the specified region.\n\nIf you've already set a region during the initial setup, that region will remain fixed for future deployments, so you don't need to specify it again during `gcloud app deploy`."
